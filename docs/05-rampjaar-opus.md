## The Rijksmuseum and the Crisis Decade of the 1670s: A Data-Driven Analysis

### 1. The Quantitative Picture: Decade-Level Comparison

| Decade | Total Objects | Paintings | Change vs. Prior Decade |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **1650s** | **12,714** | — | — |
| **1660s** | **9,427** | **263** | −25.8% from 1650s |
| **1670s** | **9,392** | **152** | −0.4% total; **−42.2% paintings** |
| **1680s** | **9,844** | **66** | +4.8% total; −56.6% paintings |

At the *all-objects* level, the 1670s (9,392) are essentially flat against the 1660s (9,427) — a negligible −0.4% dip. The **big drop actually occurred between the 1650s and 1660s** (−25.8%), suggesting the golden peak of Dutch production visible in the collection is the 1650s.

However, **paintings specifically** show a dramatic and continuous decline: **263 → 152 → 66** across the 1660s–1680s. The 1670s represent a **42% drop in paintings** from the 1660s. This is significant.

### 2. Year-by-Year Within the 1670s: The Crisis Curve

| Year | Total Objects |
|------|-------------|
| **1670** | **4,753** ← inflated (many objects dated broadly "1670") |
| **1671** | **999** |
| **1672** (Rampjaar) | **1,658** |
| **1673** | **1,462** |
| **1674** | **1,107** |
| **1675** | **3,282** ← also a round-number magnet |
| **1676** | **1,488** |
| **1677** | **2,036** |
| **1678** | **1,274** |
| **1679** | **1,588** |

Oddly, **1672 itself shows no dip** — indeed, at 1,658 it *exceeds* 1671 (999). This is explained by the **enormous documentary response** to the crisis: the Rijksmuseum holds **1,305 prints alone** from 1672, many being political broadsides, pamphlet illustrations, satirical engravings, and commemorative medals responding to the invasion and the murders of the De Witt brothers. The crisis *generated* printed material even as it suppressed painting commissions.

By medium in the 1670s:
- **Prints**: 7,456 — the overwhelming majority (~79%)
- **Drawings**: 647
- **Paintings**: 152

### 3. The Painting Collapse Is Real

The painting count tells the real story. Compared to 263 paintings in the 1660s, **only 34 paintings** in the collection are dated precisely to 1672. This is consistent with the economic shock: the French invasion caused massive capital destruction, the deliberate flooding of the Water Line devastated agricultural land, trade collapsed, and the art market — which depended on bourgeois disposable income — contracted sharply.

### 4. What the Rijksmuseum *Does* Hold from 1672: The Rampjaar as Subject

The crisis itself became a major artistic subject. Key works include:

- **SK-A-15**: *The Corpses of the De Witt Brothers* (attr. Jan de Baen, c. 1672–75) — The museum's most visceral Rampjaar painting. The inscription claims it was painted "naer het leeven" (from life) on 20 August 1672, showing the flayed bodies of Johan and Cornelis de Witt hanging at the Vijverberg. It has 27 bibliography entries — one of the most studied political paintings in the collection. Currently displayed in the "Citizens in Power" gallery (HG-2.18).

- **SK-A-3753**: *Louis XIV Crossing into the Netherlands at Lobith* (Adam Frans van der Meulen, 1672–90) — Painted from the *French* perspective, glorifying Louis XIV's Rhine crossing on 12 June 1672 with his 120,000-man army. The curatorial narrative notes the artist "took some liberties" — Louis was actually in a monastery during the crossing. Displayed in the William III gallery (HG-2.22).

- **SK-A-4**: *The Threatened Swan* (Jan Asselijn, c. 1650) — Though painted ~20 years earlier, this became the Rijksmuseum's most famous Rampjaar icon. Later inscriptions identify the swan as "de Raad-Pensionaris" (Johan de Witt), the egg as "Holland," and the dog as "de viand van de staat." It entered the Nationale Kunstgalerij in 1800 as the **very first acquisition** — the founding object of what became the Rijksmuseum. Displayed in the Gallery of Honour (Top 100 collection).

Additionally, the collection holds **commemorative medals** from Leiden and Groningen (KOG-S-MP-15, KOG-S-MP-16-2, KOG-S-MP-17) honoring armed citizens and the siege/relief of Groningen — material culture of civic defiance.

There are also **9 objects explicitly tagged "Rampjaar"** in their titles, and **14 objects tagged "Rampjaar (Disaster Year)"** in subject metadata.

### 5. Interpretation: Is There a Measurable Drop?

**Yes, but it's nuanced:**

- **Paintings**: Unambiguous collapse. The 1670s hold **42% fewer paintings** than the 1660s, and the 1680s decline further still (−57% from the 1670s). The patron class — urban regents, merchants, guild officers — was economically devastated, and painting commissions dried up.

- **Prints**: Massive *increase*. The crisis was a propaganda bonanza. With 7,456 prints from the 1670s, this medium actually *surges*, driven by political satire, news reportage, and commemorative publishing. The Rampjaar paradoxically stimulated the graphic arts.

- **Total objects**: Essentially flat, because the print surge masks the painting decline.

- **The 1650s remain the peak**: The real "golden" decade in the Rijksmuseum's holdings is the 1650s at 12,714 objects — over 35% more than any subsequent decade. The decline begins before the Rampjaar.

### 6. Caveats

These numbers reflect the Rijksmuseum's **acquisition history**, not raw 17th-century production. The museum has long prioritized the mid-century "Golden Age" (Rembrandt, Vermeer, Hals) and Rampjaar documentary material. Later-century works may be underrepresented simply because they were less aggressively collected. The round-number years (1670, 1675) are inflated because many objects carry approximate dates. And some "1672" objects were actually made later in response to the events of that year.

Still, the overall pattern — a painting market that contracted under the weight of the French invasion, compensated by a print industry that *thrived* on the crisis — aligns well with what art historians like John Michael Montias and Marion Boers have documented about the economics of Dutch Golden Age art production.
