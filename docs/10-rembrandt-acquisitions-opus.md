# How the Rijksmuseum Built Its Rembrandt Painting Collection

The Rijksmuseum holds **20 paintings** attributed to Rembrandt van Rijn. The acquisition history reveals a remarkably diverse set of pathways, spanning over two centuries — from the Napoleonic era to the 21st century. Here is a systematic breakdown:

---

## 1. LONG-TERM LOANS FROM THE CITY OF AMSTERDAM (earliest stratum — 1808)

The **foundational layer** of the Rembrandt collection came not through purchase or bequest but through **municipal transfer/loan** when the museum was established under Louis Napoleon. These are paintings that belonged to the City of Amsterdam by virtue of their original civic commissions:

| # | Work | Object No. | Date on Loan | Route |
|---|------|-----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | **The Night Watch** | SK-C-5 | 1808 | Kloveniersdoelen → Town Hall (1715) → Trippenhuis (1808) → museum. Still on loan from the City of Amsterdam. |
| 2 | **The Syndics** | SK-C-6 | 1808 | Drapers' Guild Hall → Town Hall (1771) → museum (1808). On loan from the City of Amsterdam. |
| 3 | **The Jewish Bride** | SK-C-216 | 1854 (Van der Hoop) | On loan from the City of Amsterdam (A. van der Hoop Bequest — Van der Hoop bequeathed his collection to the City, which deposited it at the museum). |
| 4 | **Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Jan Deijman** (fragment) | SK-C-1855 | — | On loan from the Amsterdam Museum. |

**Proportion: 4 of 20 (20%)** — all on loan from Amsterdam civic institutions.

---

## 2. PRIVATE LOANS FROM FAMILY FOUNDATIONS

| # | Work | Object No. | Lender |
|---|------|-----------|--------|
| 5 | **Portrait of Maria Trip** | SK-C-597 | On loan from the Familie Van Weede Stichting (a family foundation). |

**Proportion: 1 of 20 (5%).**

---

## 3. GIFTS AND BEQUESTS FROM PRIVATE COLLECTORS

| # | Work | Object No. | Year | Donor |
|---|------|-----------|------|-------|
| 6 | **Man in Oriental Dress** | SK-A-3340 | **1940** | Gift of Mr & Mrs Kessler-Hülsmann (donated with 83 other objects). Purchased at auction in 1922, given in 1940. |
| 7 | **Self-portrait as the Apostle Paul** | SK-A-4050 | **1960** | Bequest of Isaäc de Bruijn and Johanna van der Leeuw (Muri, Switzerland). On loan 1956–60, bequeathed December 1960. |
| 8 | **Young Woman in Fantasy Costume** | SK-A-4057 | **1933/1961** | Gift of De Bruijn-van der Leeuw to the Vereniging Rembrandt for the museum in 1933 (50th anniversary), kept in usufruct, transferred 1961. |

**Proportion: 3 of 20 (15%).**

---

## 4. WWII WAR RECUPERATION / STATE TRANSFER (SNK)

Two paintings were looted or sold under duress for Hitler's planned Führermuseum in Linz, recovered after WWII by the Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit (SNK), and transferred to the Rijksmuseum in 1960:

| # | Work | Object No. | Seized | Recovered | To Museum |
|---|------|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| 9 | **Still Life with Peacocks** | SK-A-3981 | 1942 (from Chabot, fl. 800,000, to Göpel/Hitler) | Nov 1945 (NK 2346) | **1960** |
| 10 | **Portrait of Ephraim Bueno** | SK-A-3982 | 1940 (from Mannheimer collection via Mendelssohn bank) | Oct 1945 | **1960** |

**Proportion: 2 of 20 (10%).** These have a uniquely dark provenance — both passed through Nazi hands.

---

## 5. PURCHASES (the largest category)

The museum actively purchased Rembrandt paintings from **1900 to 2022**, almost always with coalitions of support:

| # | Work | Object No. | Year Acquired | Price/Note | Key Supporters |
|---|------|-----------|------|------|-----|
| 11 | **Landscape with a Stone Bridge** | SK-A-1935 | **1900** | 2,200 gns at Christie's | Vereniging Rembrandt + Abraham Bredius |
| 12 | **Joseph Telling his Dreams** | SK-A-3477 | **1946** | fl. 50,000 (from Volz estate) | Vereniging Rembrandt + Stichting tot Bevordering van de Belangen van het Rijksmuseum |
| 13 | **Musical Company** | SK-A-4674 | **1976** | fl. 648,000 | Vereniging Rembrandt + Prins Bernhard Fonds + Commissie voor Fotoverkoop |
| 14 | **Self-portrait (c. 1628)** | SK-A-4691 | **1977** | fl. 1,800,000 | Vereniging Rembrandt + Prins Bernhard Fonds + Ministerie van CRM + others |
| 15 | **Tobit and Anna with the Kid** | SK-A-4717 | **1979** | fl. 3,000,000 | Vereniging Rembrandt + Rijksmuseum Stichting + State of the Netherlands |
| 16 | **Portrait of Haesje van Cleyburg** | SK-A-4833 | **1985** | fl. 10,000,000 | Stichting Jubileumfonds (centenary of the building) + Vereniging Rembrandt + businesses + individuals |
| 17 | **Johannes Wtenbogaert** | SK-A-4885 | **1992** | £4,180,000 at Sotheby's | Vereniging Rembrandt + Prins Bernhard Fonds + VSB Fonds + Rijksmuseum-Stichting + State |
| 18 | **The Standard Bearer** | SK-A-5092 | **c. 2021–22** | (Most recent; massive coalition) | Dutch State + Vereniging Rembrandt (multiple sub-funds) + Rijksmuseum Fonds + Friends Lottery |

**And the joint Franco-Dutch acquisition:**

| # | Work | Object No. | Year | Note |
|---|------|-----------|------|------|
| 19 | **Portrait of Marten Soolmans** | SK-A-5033 | **2016** | Joint acquisition by the Dutch State and the French Republic; shared with the Musée du Louvre |
| 20 | **Portrait of Oopjen Coppit** | SK-C-1768 | **2016** | Same deal — the pendant pair was bought jointly for a reported €160 million total |

**Proportion: 10 of 20 (50%)** were outright purchases.

## Summary Statistics

| Acquisition Mode | Count | % of 20 | Period |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Purchase** (with coalition support) | **10** | **50%** | 1900–2022 |
| **Civic loan** (City of Amsterdam / Amsterdam Museum) | **4** | **20%** | 1808–present |
| **Gift / Bequest** (private collectors) | **3** | **15%** | 1933–1961 |
| **WWII recuperation** (state transfer via SNK) | **2** | **10%** | 1960 |
| **Private foundation loan** | **1** | **5%** | Ongoing |

## Key Patterns and Observations

1. **The Vereniging Rembrandt is the single most important supporting institution.** Founded in 1883, it participated in the purchase of at least **8 of the 10 purchased paintings** — from the very first acquisition in 1900 (*Landscape with a Stone Bridge*) to *The Standard Bearer* in the 2020s. It is tagged in the collection set metadata for all these works.

2. **The foundational core is a civic inheritance, not a purchase.** The two most famous paintings — *The Night Watch* and *The Syndics* — were never bought by the Rijksmuseum at all. They came with the City of Amsterdam's civic guard and guild paintings when the museum was established in 1808. They are **still technically on loan** from the municipality.

3. **Acquisition costs escalated dramatically.** From 2,200 guineas in 1900 to an implied ~€80 million per painting for the Soolmans/Coppit pair in 2016. Even the 1985 purchase of *Haesje van Cleyburg* at fl. 10 million required a special jubilee fund plus broad public and private support.

4. **The 1960s were a watershed decade.** Five paintings entered the collection around 1960 — two via WWII restitution/transfer (Peacocks, Bueno), two via the De Bruijn-van der Leeuw bequest (*Self-portrait as Paul*, *Young Woman in Fantasy Costume*), all clustered in 1960–61.

5. **International diplomacy entered the picture in 2016.** The Marten & Oopjen portraits required an unprecedented joint acquisition between two sovereign states (Netherlands and France), creating a shared-custody arrangement alternating between the Rijksmuseum and the Louvre.

6. **WWII provenance remains a sensitive element.** Both *Still Life with Peacocks* and *Portrait of Ephraim Bueno* were forcibly acquired for Hitler's planned Führermuseum. Their post-war path through the SNK to the museum in 1960 reflects the complex restitution landscape of the Netherlands.

In short, the Rijksmuseum's Rembrandt collection was built in layers: a civic foundation from 1808, strategic private generosity in the mid-20th century, and an increasingly expensive campaign of market purchases from 1900 to the present — almost always underwritten by public-private coalitions anchored by the Vereniging Rembrandt.
