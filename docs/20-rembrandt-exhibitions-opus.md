# Rembrandt-Related Curated Sets at the Rijksmuseum: Objects and Curatorial Narratives

The Rijksmuseum maintains two major curated sets explicitly related to Rembrandt, each constructing a distinct narrative about his legacy. Here is a detailed analysis:

---

## 1. "Drawings by Rembrandt and his School in the Rijksmuseum" (Set 2619)

**Scale:** 139 objects — exclusively drawings

This is a scholarly, connoisseurial set that constructs the narrative of **Rembrandt as teacher, workshop master, and peerless draftsman**. The curatorial selection is organized around several interrelated themes:

### A. Rembrandt's Personal Evolution as a Draftsman (~1628–1662)

The set opens with Rembrandt's earliest drawings and traces his evolution across four decades:

| Period | Key Works | Narrative Focus |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Leiden (c. 1628–30)** | *Self-portrait with Tousled Hair* (RP-T-1961-75), *Standing Man with a Stick* (RP-T-1889-A-2046), *Study of a Woman's Legs* (RP-T-1930-54) | The ambitious young artist observing the world with black and red chalk — raw talent, attention to the physical body |
| **Early Amsterdam (c. 1634–40)** | *The Pancake Woman* (RP-T-1891-A-2424), *Saskia in Bed* (RP-T-1901-A-4520), *Bedroom with Saskia* (RP-T-1930-53), *Actor as Capitano* (RP-T-1961-76) | Street life, domestic intimacy, and theatre — Rembrandt as an observer of human character |
| **Mature Period (c. 1641–55)** | *Jacob and his Sons* (RP-T-1901-A-4518), *Daniel in the Lions' Den* (RP-T-1930-17), *Christ Healing a Leper* (RP-T-1930-24) | Biblical narratives with deep psychological insight — figures that "think" |
| **Late Period (c. 1655–62)** | *Jael Killing Sisera* (RP-T-1930-8), *Nude Woman Seated by a Stove* (RP-T-00-227), *A Syndic (Jacob van Loon)* (RP-T-1896-A-3172), *Mughal copies* (RP-T-1961-82/83) | Radical economy of line, global cultural curiosity, and the preparation studies for masterworks like *The Syndics* (SK-C-6) |

**Curatorial narrative insight:** The curatorial texts explicitly position Rembrandt as someone who drew from life, sought "the most natural emotions" (as he wrote to Constantijn Huygens), and used drawings as private laboratories for compositional ideas — e.g. the *Studies for the Sick Woman in the Hundred Guilder Print* (RP-T-1964-127) show him testing poses before committing them to etching.

### B. Master and School — Questions of Attribution

A crucial curatorial strategy is the inclusion of approximately **40–50 drawings by pupils and anonymous members of Rembrandt's School** alongside autograph works. These include:

- **Ferdinand Bol**: *Hagar and the Angel* (RP-T-1930-27), *Standing Shepherdess* (RP-T-1889-A-2060), *Minerva in her Study* (RP-T-1975-85), *Noli me tangere* (RP-T-1930-29)
- **Anonymous School members**: *Jacob Being Shown Joseph's Blood-stained Coat* (RP-T-1930-5), *Christ Presented to the People* (RP-T-1961-84), *Judah and Tamar* (RP-T-1971-88), *Good Samaritan* (RP-T-1901-A-4528)
- **Late copies**: *Saskia Ill in Bed* (RP-T-00-221, c. 1693–1700) — a copy made after Rembrandt's death

**The narrative constructed:** By juxtaposing autograph Rembrandts alongside school works treating **the same biblical stories** (e.g., multiple versions of Esther/Haman, Joseph cycles, Noli me tangere), the curators invite viewers to perceive stylistic differences and understand the workshop as a creative ecosystem. The set implicitly tells the story of how attributions shift over time — works once considered Rembrandt's that are now "anonymous, School of Rembrandt."

### C. Thematic Threads

The 139 drawings cluster around recurring subjects:

- **Biblical narratives** (~35%): Jacob, Joseph, Esther, Christ's Passion, Daniel, Ruth & Boaz, Good Samaritan
- **Street life & daily observation** (~20%): The Pancake Woman, women and children, men in conversation, beggars
- **Amsterdam topography** (~10%): Views of the Amstel from the Blauwbrug, the Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal, the Swijgh Utrecht tower, the Amstelveenseweg
- **Saskia & domestic life** (~8%): Saskia in bed, Saskia at window, bedroom scenes
- **Animals** (~8%): Multiple lion studies (at least 5), horses, a cow
- **Mughal miniature copies** (4 works): Jahangir, Shah Jahan, Indian Archer — evidence of Rembrandt's global visual curiosity
- **Theatre/Commedia dell'Arte** (3–4 works): Capitano, Pantalone, actor Willem Ruyter as Ahasuerus
- **Life drawing/nudes** (2–3 works): Late nude studies from Amsterdam painters' guild sessions

### D. Connecting Drawings to Paintings

The curators consistently link drawings to the museum's own paintings. The *Syndic study* (RP-T-1896-A-3172) is explicitly connected to *The Syndics* (SK-C-6, 1662); the *Swijgh Utrecht tower* drawing (RP-T-1969-222) tells us where *The Night Watch* (SK-C-5) originally hung; the *Mourning Magdalen studies* (RP-T-1947-213) relate to the Passion series for Prince Frederick Henry. This cross-referencing constructs Rembrandt as a **process-oriented artist** whose finished masterpieces emerged from sustained graphic investigation.

## 2. "Vereniging Rembrandt" (Set 260215)

**Scale:** 3,755 objects — vastly larger and more diverse

This is **not an exhibition about Rembrandt himself** but rather the collection assembled with the support of the **Vereniging Rembrandt** (Rembrandt Association), the museum's most important acquisition support society, founded in 1883. The narrative here is institutional: **how the memory and prestige of Rembrandt's name was used to build a national collection.**

The set contains:
- **Rembrandt drawings** that were acquired with Vereniging Rembrandt funding (e.g., *Jacob and his Sons*, purchased 1901 for fl. 345; *Three Women and a Child* RP-T-1889-A-2056; *Reclining Lion* RP-T-1901-A-4524)
- Works by **other Dutch Golden Age masters**: Gerard ter Borch (I) drawings
- **Modern and contemporary acquisitions** across all media, including 20th-century photography (e.g., the extensive Sanne Sannes photo series from c. 1964–67)
- Works spanning from the 16th century through the modern era

**The narrative constructed:** The Vereniging Rembrandt set tells the story of **institutional collecting in Rembrandt's name**. It demonstrates how the national reverence for Rembrandt became a fundraising mechanism that ultimately enriched the museum's holdings far beyond Dutch Golden Age art. The provenance of *Jacob and his Sons* is emblematic: it passed through the hands of great collectors (Suermondt, Knowles) before being purchased in 1895 specifically through the Vereniging Rembrandt for 345 guilders.

## Overarching Curatorial Strategies

1. **The autograph/school dialectic**: By including ~40 "School" drawings alongside confirmed Rembrandts, the curators acknowledge that connoisseurship itself is part of the story. Many works carry curatorial hedging ("Saskia?" in RP-T-1930-51; "anonymous" for drawings once given to Rembrandt).

2. **Process over product**: Drawings are presented as thinking tools — preliminary studies, compositional experiments, on-the-spot observations — not finished artworks. The curatorial texts emphasize phrases like "tried out various poses," "scratched over earlier lines," "gave free rein to his imagination while drawing."

3. **Rembrandt as cosmopolitan observer**: The inclusion of Mughal miniature copies, Amsterdam cityscapes, Oriental figures, Commedia dell'Arte actors, and domestic scenes constructs a Rembrandt who was deeply embedded in 17th-century Amsterdam's global, multicultural reality.

4. **The personal within the professional**: Drawings of Saskia ill in bed, pregnant, or nursing weave Rembrandt's biography into his artistic output, creating an intimate portrait of the artist's life alongside his creative practice.

5. **The Rijksmuseum's 544 Rembrandts in context**: With 544 total works by Rembrandt in the collection (paintings, prints, and drawings), these curated sets help visitors navigate the vastness — the drawings set alone represents about 25% of the total, providing the most intimate window into the master's working methods.
