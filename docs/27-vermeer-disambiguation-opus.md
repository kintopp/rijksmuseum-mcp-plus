### ✅ *The Milkmaid* — **Yes, it's in the Rijksmuseum**
- **Object number:** SK-A-2344
- **Date:** c. 1660
- **Medium:** Oil on canvas, 45.5 × 41 cm
- **Location:** Gallery of Honour (Eregalerij), the museum's most prestigious gallery
- **Acquired:** 1908, purchased with support of the Vereniging Rembrandt
- **Curatorial note:** *"A maidservant pours milk, entirely absorbed in her work. Except for the stream of milk, everything else is still. Vermeer took this simple everyday activity and made it the subject of an impressive painting — the woman stands like a statue in the brightly lit room."*

### ❌ *Girl with a Pearl Earring* — **Not in the Rijksmuseum**
The search returned zero results, and for good reason: *Girl with a Pearl Earring* (c. 1665) is housed at the **Mauritshuis** in The Hague — a different Dutch museum entirely. It has been in that collection since 1902.

### What I *can* help you compare
Since the Rijksmuseum actually holds **four Vermeer paintings**, I could help you compare *The Milkmaid* with another Vermeer in the same collection, such as:

- **The Love Letter** (c. 1669–1670)
- **Woman Reading a Letter** (c. 1663)
- **The Little Street** (c. 1658)

Would you like me to pull up details on any of these for a side-by-side comparison? Or I can provide a full timeline of Vermeer works in the Rijksmuseum if that's helpful!
