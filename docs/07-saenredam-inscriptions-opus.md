# Textual Inscriptions in Pieter Saenredam's Church Interior Paintings at the Rijksmuseum

The Rijksmuseum holds **6 paintings** by Pieter Jansz Saenredam. Of these, **5 contain recorded inscriptions** — only the modest *Westernmost Bays of the South Aisle of the Mariakerk* (**SK-A-1189**, c. 1640–45) has none. The inscriptions fall into several distinct categories, each serving a different — sometimes overlapping — purpose.

---

## 1. DOCUMENTARY INSCRIPTIONS: Identifying the Building

Saenredam frequently painted **topographical captions** directly onto his works, identifying the exact building depicted. This is remarkable and virtually unique among 17th-century Dutch painters:

- **SK-A-851** (*Nave and Choir of the Mariakerk in Utrecht*, 1641): Lower right, above the signature — **"Dit is de Mariae kerck / binnen uijttrecht"** ("This is the Mariakerk in Utrecht"). Written in the artist's own hand as a caption within the painting itself.

- **SK-C-217** (*Interior of the Sint-Odulphuskerk in Assendelft*, 1649): Lower left, on a pew — **"dit is de kerck tot Assendelft, een dorp in Hollandt, van / Pieter Saenredam, dese geschildert int jaer 1649. den 2. Octoberâ** ("this is the church at Assendelft, a village in Holland, by Pieter Saenredam, this painted in the year 1649, the 2nd of October"). This combines identification, attribution, and precise dating in a single caption.

- **SK-C-1409** (*The Old Town Hall of Amsterdam*, 1657): On the step — **"Dit is het oude Raethuijs der stadt Amsterdam, welck afbrande int jaer 1651 den 7 julij, in 3 uren tyt sonder meer."** ("This is the old Town Hall of the city of Amsterdam, which burned down in the year 1651, the 7th of July, in just 3 hours.") This is the most historically charged inscription: it transforms the painting into a **memorial record**, documenting a building that no longer existed by the time the painting was completed.

### Purpose: Strictly **documentary**
These texts anchor the painting as an architectural record — almost functioning as a label or a caption in a survey. This is consistent with Saenredam's working method, which was quasi-scientific: making on-site drawings, taking precise measurements, and later converting them into paintings. As the curatorial narrative for SK-C-1409 notes, the painting hung from 1658 in the Burgomasters' Chamber of the *new* Town Hall as an explicit **memento of the lost building**.

## 2. SIGNATURES & WORKING-PROCESS INSCRIPTIONS

Saenredam's signatures go far beyond mere name and year. They often record his **creative process** — the gap between drawing and painting:

- **SK-C-1409**: **"Pieter Saenredam, Heeft dit eerst naer t'Leeven Geteeckent met al sijn Coleuren int Jaer 1641. en dit Geschildert, int jaer 1657."** ("Pieter Saenredam first drew this from life with all its colours in the year 1641, and painted this in the year 1657.") A **sixteen-year gap** between observation and painting is explicitly declared — the artist treats this information as essential to the work's meaning.

- **SK-A-851**: **"Pieter Saenredam, ghemaeckt"** with the date **"[...] voleijndicht den 29. Januarij / int Jaer 1641"** ("completed the 29th of January in the year 1641"). The use of *voleijndicht* (completed/finished) implies a deliberate marking of the end of a process.

- **SK-A-359** (*St Bavo, Haarlem*, 1636): Simple signature on the small organ — **"P. Saenredam. 1636."**

- **SK-A-858** (*Transept of the Mariakerk*, 1637): Formal Latin — **"Pr Saenredam. Pinxit Anno 1637"**, plus a biographical note on the **reverse**: **"Pieter [..]enredam [...]ssendelf [...] Harlem 166[.] (Mort) / Eleve de Frans Grebber"** — recording his birthplace (Assendelft), death place (Haarlem), and teacher (Frans de Grebber). This later inscription (by another hand) shows how his paintings were treated as biographical documents.

### Purpose: **Artistic-documentary**
These inscriptions assert Saenredam's authorial identity and working method as inseparable from the artwork's value. The specificity of dates — sometimes exact to the day — transforms each painting into a dated archival document.

## 3. DEVOTIONAL / SCRIPTURAL TEXTS (Depicted, Not Added)

The most theologically significant inscription appears in:

- **SK-A-359** (*St Bavo, Haarlem*, 1636): On the large organ, Saenredam faithfully reproduced the biblical texts painted on the organ case:
  - **"[LOOFT HEM MET SNARENSPEL] EN[DE] ORGEL PSALM. [CL]"** — from **Psalm 150:4**: "Praise him with stringed instruments and organ."
  - **"[LEERT EN VERMAENT ELKANDER MET PSALMEN E]NDE [LOF]ZANGEN EN[DE] GEESTELYCKE LIEDEKENS"** — from **Colossians 3:16**: "Teach and admonish one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs."

These are not Saenredam's own additions but are **texts that existed on the organ** — he depicted them as part of the architectural fabric. As the curatorial narrative explains, the organ also bore a painted *Resurrection of Christ*, "a remnant of the by-then long-abolished Catholic decoration." Saenredam recorded these devotional fragments with the same documentary fidelity he brought to columns and arches.

### Purpose: **Documentary recording of devotional content**
Though the texts themselves are devotional, Saenredam's inclusion of them is an act of *documentation* rather than personal piety. He faithfully transcribed what was physically present in the building.

## 4. HISTORICAL/ANTIQUARIAN INSCRIPTIONS

Two remarkable examples record local historical lore:

- **SK-A-851** (*Mariakerk, Utrecht*, 1641): On a column beneath the image of a bull, in **Latin**: **"accipe posteritas quod per tua [secula narres] / taurinus cutibus fundo solid[ata collumna est]"** — roughly: "Receive, posterity, what you may tell through the ages: this column was grounded on a bull's hide." The curatorial note explains the legend: the column kept sinking during construction until it was placed on a bull's hide. Saenredam faithfully transcribed this pre-existing Latin inscription from the column itself — a medieval curiosity legend.

- **SK-C-217** (*Assendelft*, 1649): On the tomb — **"dit is de TOMBE ofte begraefplaets vande heeren tot assendelft"** ("this is the tomb or burial place of the lords of Assendelft"), and crucially, the **gravestone inscription of his own father**: **"Iohannis Saenredam / sculptoris celeberrimi. / Petri de Ionge XLIV annos Assendelphi / praetoris. / Gerardi de Ionge filii I.V.D. et advocati. / Iacet hic quod fvit."** ("Johannes Saenredam, most celebrated engraver. Pieter de Jonge, 44 years magistrate of Assendelft. Gerard de Jonge, his son, Doctor of Laws and advocate. Here lies what once was.") The curatorial narrative emphasizes the **personal significance**: this was Saenredam's birthplace, and the painting memorializes his father Jan Saenredam, the famous engraver.

### Purpose: **Antiquarian-documentary** with strong **personal-memorial** dimensions
The Assendelft painting in particular functions as a family memorial. The Latin tomb inscription, reproduced with care, transforms the painting into a tribute to his father's legacy.

## 5. SYNTHESIS: What Purposes Do These Inscriptions Serve?

| Category | Examples | Primary Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Building identification | SK-A-851, SK-C-217, SK-C-1409 | **Documentary** — topographical record |
| Historical narration | SK-C-1409 (fire of 1651) | **Documentary-commemorative** — preserving memory of a lost building |
| Process documentation | SK-C-1409, SK-A-851 | **Artistic** — asserting method and authorship |
| Scripture/organ texts | SK-A-359 | **Devotional content, documented faithfully** |
| Antiquarian legends | SK-A-851 (bull's hide) | **Documentary-antiquarian** — recording local lore |
| Tomb/memorial texts | SK-C-217 (father's grave) | **Personal-memorial** and **genealogical** |

### Overall Assessment

Saenredam's inscriptions serve **predominantly documentary purposes**, but they operate at multiple registers simultaneously:

1. **As an architectural surveyor**, he embedded building identifications and dates with the precision of a cartographer — turning paintings into labeled records.

2. **As a historical witness**, he recorded what was physically present (organ texts, column legends, tomb inscriptions) as faithfully as he recorded light on stone. The devotional content of the Psalm 150 and Colossians texts on the St Bavo organ is incidental to his documentary impulse — he transcribed them because they *were there*.

3. **As a memorialist**, his most emotionally charged inscriptions serve commemorative purposes: the Amsterdam Town Hall painting preserves a building destroyed by fire; the Assendelft painting preserves the grave of his own father.

4. **As an artist conscious of his craft**, his process inscriptions (drawing date vs. painting date) are unique among Dutch Golden Age painters and reveal an understanding that architectural accuracy required transparency about *when* a building was observed.

What is conspicuously absent is any inscription that serves a purely *devotional* purpose in Saenredam's own voice. He was not adding Scripture as spiritual commentary — he was recording the textual fabric of post-Reformation church spaces with the same exactitude he brought to their spatial fabric. In this sense, his inscriptions confirm his reputation as the most "scientific" of Dutch architectural painters: even the words in his churches are treated as architectural facts to be documented.
