## What the Data Shows for *The Little Street* (SK-A-2860)

The Rijksmuseum's database does **not** include a dedicated "exhibition loan history" field for this painting. However, we can glean a good deal from the **21 bibliography entries** and other metadata.

### Evidence of External Exhibition Appearances

Several of the bibliography entries are **exhibition catalogues** from venues outside the Rijksmuseum, suggesting the painting was lent on at least these occasions:

| Exhibition / Catalogue | Venue(s) | Approximate Date |
|---|---|---|
| *Johannes Vermeer* (Broos & Wheelock) | The Hague (Mauritshuis) / Washington (National Gallery of Art) | 1995–96 |
| *Vermeer and the Delft School* (Liedtke et al.) | Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York / National Gallery, London | 2001 |
| *Hollandse stadsgezichten uit de Gouden Eeuw* (Van Suchtelen & Wheelock) | Mauritshuis, The Hague / National Gallery of Art, Washington | 2008 |
| *Vermeer: il secolo d'oro dell'arte olandese* (Bandera, Liedtke, Wheelock) | Rome (Scuderie del Quirinale) | 2012–13 |
| *Vermeer: la ragazza alla spinetta e i pittori di Delft* (Meijer) | Florence (Palazzo Pitti) | 2007 |
| *De Hooch–Vermeer* | Likely a smaller focused exhibition | — |

### Important Caveats

1. **The Rijksmuseum's API does not track exhibition loans as structured data.** The bibliography is the best proxy, but not every loan results in a catalogue entry, and not every catalogue citation means the painting physically traveled (it may have been illustrated as a comparison).

2. **Vermeer paintings are extraordinarily fragile and rare** (only ~35 survive), so loans are negotiated carefully and are relatively infrequent. The Rijksmuseum has historically been cautious about lending its four Vermeers.

3. Based on the catalogue evidence, *The Little Street* appears to have been **lent to at least 4–6 major international exhibitions** since the 1990s, primarily Vermeer-focused shows. The most significant was the landmark 1995–96 *Johannes Vermeer* exhibition in The Hague and Washington — the largest gathering of Vermeer paintings ever assembled.

### Summary

From the available Rijksmuseum data, **at least 5–6 external exhibition loans** can be inferred from the bibliography. For a complete, verified loan history you would need to consult the Rijksmuseum's internal registrar records, which are not exposed through the public collection API.
