## 1. 🏝️ DESHIMA ISLAND — DIRECT DEPICTIONS

The Rijksmuseum's greatest treasures for Rangaku scholars are **multiple representations of the island itself**, created both by Japanese and Dutch hands:

### ★ Scale Model of Deshima (`NG-721`)
- **Date:** 1850–1851 | **Made in:** Japan
- **Dimensions:** 198 × 81 × 36 cm — a large, detailed maquette
- **Materials:** Wood, paper, cardboard, silk, rope, watercolour, sand, ink
- **Currently on display** in the "Netherlands Overseas" gallery (HG-1.17)
- **Curatorial note:** *"The island was very small, only 214 by 64 meters. Dutch ships were loaded and unloaded at the gate on the short end. The bridge on the long side connected Deshima to the city of Nagasaki. The port was strictly guarded."*
- Part of the Rijksmuseum's **Top 1000** masterpieces. 7 scholarly references.

### ★ Bird's-Eye View of Deshima Island (`NG-1191`)
- **Workshop of Kawahara Keiga** (川原慶賀), c. 1833–1836
- **Medium:** Ink and colour on silk, in a lacquered frame with mother-of-pearl inlay
- Shows the **fan-shaped island** in remarkable detail: 20 figures, a Dutch tricolour flag, the connecting gate to the mainland, moored boats, and houses. This is likely one of the souvenir paintings Dutch visitors could purchase.
- 7 bibliography entries. Part of the **Japan (collectie)** set.

### ★ Nagasaki Bay with Deshima (`NG-1190`)
- **Workshop of Kawahara Keiga**, c. 1833–1836 — companion piece to the above

- **Curatorial note:** *"There are several known copies of this picture, which Dutch visitors bought as souvenirs of Japan."* A fire in 1859 destroyed many buildings shown.
- 11 bibliography entries — the most-studied of the group.

### Lacquer Panel Depicting Deshima (`NG-NM-9346`)
- **c. 1800–1820** | Japanese lacquer with mother-of-pearl inlay
- **Currently on display** in gallery HG-1.17 (Netherlands Overseas)
- Meticulously inlaid aerial view showing all building details, **even the VOC monogram on the flag**
- Curatorial note highlights that "lacquer with mother-of-pearl inlay was a popular Japanese product" in the 19th century — evidence of the **material culture of exchange**.

### Lacquer Panel with Names of Chief Factors (`BK-16465`)
- **c. 1850** | Japanese lacquer, gilded wood, mother-of-pearl | 162.5 × 106.5 cm
- **Currently on display** in gallery HG-1.17

- Commissioned by the Dutch government; transferred to the museum in 1950.
- 8 bibliography entries.

## 4. 🏛️ VOC TRADING POST PAINTINGS SERIES

The Rijksmuseum holds a remarkable series of **oil paintings attributed to Johannes Vinckboons (c. 1662–63)** depicting VOC trading posts across Asia, currently displayed in gallery HG-2.9:

| Object | Title | Depicts |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `SK-A-4471` | VOC Trading Posts | Part of series |

| `SK-A-4474` | View of Canton | Canton, China |
| `SK-A-4475` | Lawec & Banda | Cambodia & Moluccas |

These provide **crucial context** for understanding the VOC's network within which Deshima operated. The curatorial narrative notes this was *"a network between which not only products but also enslaved people were transported."*

Additional related paintings:
- **`SK-A-4282`**: *The Trading Post of the Dutch East India Company in Hooghly, Bengal* (Hendrik van Schuylenburgh, 1665)

## 7. 🔍 RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE RANGAKU SCHOLAR

1. **Start with the physical model** (`NG-721`) and **Kawahara Keiga paintings** (`NG-1190`, `NG-1191`) — these provide the most detailed visual documentation of Deshima's layout and daily life during the peak Rangaku period (1820s–1840s).

2. **The lacquer panel of chief factors** (`BK-16465`) is an invaluable prosopographical source — a complete list of Dutch directors 1610–1850 with ship counts.

3. **The Siebold kakemono** (`NG-1978-111`) is directly relevant to Rangaku: it shows the very practice of knowledge exchange — a Dutch physician dictating, with Japanese and Javanese intermediaries present.

4. **The Nagasaki-e print** (`RP-P-1956-461`) and **Sadahide woodcut** (`NG-663-3`) show how Japanese artists visualized the Dutch — essential for understanding the Japanese reception side of Rangaku.

5. **The anti-foreign porcelain dish** (`NG-1979-19-1`) with its Tenpō-era inscription provides a counter-narrative: evidence of the xenophobic sentiment that existed *alongside* Rangaku curiosity.

6. **The Japan (collectie) curated set** (set `26134`) contains **7,735 objects** and is worth systematic browsing for additional connections.

7. Note that three key Deshima objects are **currently on display** in the "Netherlands Overseas" gallery (HG-1.17): the model, and both lacquer panels. All images are available at high resolution under a CC0 public domain license, making them freely usable for scholarly publication.
