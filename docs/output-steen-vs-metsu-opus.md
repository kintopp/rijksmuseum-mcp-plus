# Jan Steen vs. Gabriël Metsu: Two Genre Painters Compared

## Biographical Overview

Both artists were born in **Leiden** — Steen in 1626, Metsu in 1629 — and both eventually settled in **Amsterdam**, where they were active in the late 1650s and 1660s. Metsu died young in 1667 (age ~38), while Steen returned to Leiden and worked until 1679 (age ~53). This difference in lifespan is starkly reflected in the Rijksmuseum holdings.

## Collection Footprint

| | **Jan Steen** | **Gabriël Metsu** |
|---|---|---|
| **Total works in Rijksmuseum** | **25** | **5** |
| **Types** | Paintings + drawings | Paintings only |
| **Date range** | c. 1650 – 1672 | c. 1650 – c. 1664 |
| **"Top 100" works** | 2 (SK-C-229, SK-A-4981) | 0 |
| **"Top 1000" works** | ≥3 | ≥4 (all 5 paintings qualify) |

Steen's representation is **five times larger**, owing both to his longer career and to his prodigious output (estimated at 800+ paintings in total, vs. roughly 300 for Metsu). Still, the Rijksmuseum clearly values the Metsu paintings it holds — four of his five works sit in the Top 1000.

## Scholarly Weight (Bibliography Counts)

| Work | Bibliography entries |
|---|---|
| **Steen**, *The Merry Family* (SK-C-229, 1668) | **39** |
| **Steen**, *The Drunken Couple* (SK-C-232) | **38** |
| **Steen**, *The Burgomaster of Delft* (SK-A-4981, 1655) | **26** |
| **Steen**, *The Feast of St Nicholas* (SK-A-385) | **17** |
| **Metsu**, *The Hunter's Present* (SK-C-177) | **6** |
| **Metsu**, *The Cat's Breakfast* (SK-C-560) | **5** |
| **Metsu**, *Old Woman Meditating* (SK-A-672) | **4** |
| **Metsu**, *Man and Woman at Breakfast* (SK-A-249) | **3** |

Steen's major works attract **6–10× more scholarly citations** than Metsu's. This gap partly reflects Steen's higher canonical status, but also the sheer narrative density of his paintings, which reward literary and iconographic analysis.

## Chronological Trajectories

### Jan Steen — A Long, Itinerant Career (c. 1650–1679)
- **Early 1650s (Leiden/The Hague):** Formative drawings like *Study of a Seated Man Smoking a Pipe* (RP-T-1888-A-1514(R)) and the tavern scene *Inn Scene with Card Players* (RP-T-1949-66). Already experimenting with comic subjects.
- **Mid-1650s (Delft period):** The remarkable portrait *Adolf and Catharina Croeser* (SK-A-4981, **1655**) — now hanging in the **Gallery of Honour** — reveals Steen as far more than a comic painter. The curatorial narrative notes that Croeser later stood surety for Steen's debts, hinting at the artist's famously chaotic finances.
- **Late 1650s–1660s (Haarlem/Amsterdam peak):** His greatest genre masterpieces: *The Drunken Couple* (SK-C-232), *The Feast of St Nicholas* (SK-A-385, 1665–68), and the iconic *The Merry Family* (SK-C-229, signed **1668**). These are **large-format canvases** (the *Merry Family* measures 110.5 × 141 cm) crowded with figures, proverbs, and moral lessons embedded in ribald humor.
- **1670s (return to Leiden):** Later works like *Peasant Wedding* (SK-A-388, **1672**), *The Merry Homecoming* (SK-A-389), and a *Self-portrait* (SK-A-383, c. 1670) show an undiminished appetite for boisterous subjects.

### Gabriël Metsu — A Brief, Concentrated Arc (c. 1650–c. 1664)
- **Early 1650s (Leiden):** *Man and Woman at the Breakfast Table* (SK-A-249, 1650–60) shows Metsu working in a modest, earthy vein — oil on canvas mounted on panel, just 35.5 × 29 cm. Simple domestic subject: a couple sharing ham, cheese, bread, and beer.
- **Late 1650s–early 1660s (Amsterdam):** *The Hunter's Present* (SK-C-177, c. 1658–61, 51 × 48 cm) reveals his mature style: an intimate two-figure scene dense with erotic symbolism (the Cupid statuette, the euphemism of "birding"), painted with luminous precision.
- **Early 1660s:** His remaining Rijksmuseum works cluster tightly — *The Old Drinker* (SK-A-250), *Old Woman Meditating* (SK-A-672, 27.3 × 23.2 cm), and *The Cat's Breakfast* (SK-C-560, 34 × 27 cm) — all dated c. 1661–64. Then silence: Metsu died in Amsterdam in 1667.

## Key Artistic Differences

### 1. Scale and Ambition
Steen worked **large**: *The Merry Family* at 110.5 × 141 cm is a theatrical stage filled with over a dozen figures. Metsu worked **intimate**: his largest Rijksmuseum painting (*The Hunter's Present*) is just 51 × 48 cm. The *Old Woman Meditating* is a cabinet piece of 27.3 × 23.2 cm — roughly the size of a modern hardcover book.

### 2. Narrative Strategy
- **Steen** is a **comic moralist** who fills his scenes with crowds, proverbs, and embedded texts. *The Merry Family* literally contains a note on the mantelpiece reading *"As the old sing, so shall the young twitter"*; *The Drunken Couple* includes an owl print signifying blindness/folly. He layers meaning through sheer abundance of figures and objects.
- **Metsu** is a **psychologist of the quiet moment**. *The Hunter's Present* distills a romantic proposition into a single glance — the woman hesitates between the offered bird and a prayer book. *Old Woman Meditating* captures a fragile instant of consciousness — has she paused in thought, or dozed off? Where Steen shouts, Metsu whispers.

### 3. Materials
Steen overwhelmingly used **oil on canvas** (the standard for his large compositions), with one notable oil-on-**oak panel** work (*The Drunken Couple*, SK-C-232). Metsu shows more variety: **oil on panel** (*The Cat's Breakfast*, *Old Woman Meditating*) and even **oil on canvas mounted on panel** (*Man and Woman at Breakfast*) — techniques suited to the small, jewel-like precision of his surfaces.

### 4. Subject Matter Overlap and Divergence
Both painters depicted **domestic interiors**, **meals and drinking**, and **moral/emblematic themes**. But their emphases differ:

| Subject | Steen | Metsu |
|---|---|---|
| Festive chaos / crowds | ✅ dominant | ❌ rare |
| Quiet domestic intimacy | occasional | ✅ dominant |
| Proverbs / moral texts | ✅ explicit | subtle / symbolic |
| Religious subjects | ✅ (*Supper at Emmaus*, *Adoration*) | contemplative piety (*Old Woman Meditating*) |
| Portraiture | ✅ (*Burgomaster of Delft*, *Self-portrait*) | ❌ absent in Rijksmuseum |

### 5. Institutional Standing
Steen holds **two paintings in the Rijksmuseum's "Top 100"** — a mark of canonical superstardom alongside Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Hals. His *Burgomaster of Delft* hangs in the **Gallery of Honour** (the museum's most prestigious location) and was purchased in 2004 for **€11.9 million** with support from multiple national funds. Metsu's works, while all treasured, do not reach quite this tier of institutional prestige.

## Conclusion

The Rijksmuseum's holdings crystallize a familiar art-historical assessment: **Steen was the boisterous storyteller** — prolific, theatrical, morally inventive, working on a grand scale across a long career. **Metsu was the refined observer** — quieter, more psychologically penetrating, working in intimate formats during a career tragically cut short. They were painting in the same Dutch cities for the same bourgeois market at exactly the same moment, yet their artistic temperaments could hardly be more distinct. The 25-to-5 ratio in collection holdings, and the 39-to-6 disparity in bibliography counts, tells us that posterity has rewarded Steen's exuberance — but Metsu's subtle genius is no less prized per work.
