### Provenance as a Mirror of Reputation

The ownership history, as recorded by the Rijksmuseum, reads like a barometer of Vermeer's critical fortune:

#### 1. **The Patron's Circle (c. 1660–1696): A Valued Local Treasure**
The painting likely originated in the collection of **Pieter Claesz van Ruijven** (1624–1674) and his wife **Maria Simonsdr de Knuijt** in Delft — thought to be Vermeer's most important patron. It then likely passed to their daughter **Magdalena van Ruijven** and her widower **Jacob Dissius** (1653–1695). At the famous **Dissius sale of 16 May 1696** — the largest single-owner group of Vermeers ever auctioned — it sold as lot 2 for **fl. 175** to **Isaac Rooleeuw**. This was a healthy price for the time and shows the painting was already prized among Delft connoisseurs, though Vermeer had no international fame.

#### 2. **Early 18th Century: Modest but Steady Value**
- At the **Rooleeuw sale (1701)**, it fetched **fl. 320** — nearly double the 1696 price, suggesting rising esteem among Amsterdam collectors.
- At the **Jacob van Hoek sale (1719)**, however, it dropped to **fl. 126**. This decline is consistent with the broader 18th-century *eclipse* of Vermeer's reputation: he was a name known mainly to specialist dealers, not to the wider public.

#### 3. **Mid-18th Century: The Connoisseurs' Rediscovery Begins**
The painting entered the collection of **Pieter Leendert de Neufville** (after 1752) and was sold at the **De Neufville sale (1765)** for **fl. 560** — a significant jump. It was bought by the dealer **Yver**, indicating growing art-trade interest. Just three years later, at the **Jean Dulong sale (1768)**, it rose again to **fl. 925**, bought by **Van Diemen**. This steep price escalation over just a few years suggests that sophisticated Amsterdam dealers were beginning to recognize Vermeer as something special well before the 19th-century "rediscovery" usually credited to Thoré-Bürger.

#### 4. **Late 18th Century: Elite Amsterdam Collections**
The painting entered the collection of **Jan Jacob de Bruyn** (1720–1792), a prominent Amsterdam collector. At his posthumous sale **(1798)**, it brought **fl. 1,550** — a price that marks *The Milkmaid* as one of the most expensive Dutch genre paintings of its day. Vermeer's reputation was clearly ascending among the Amsterdam patriciate even before the Romantic era.

#### 5. **19th Century: From the Market to Dynastic Ownership**
At the **Hendrik Muilman sale (1813)**, the painting sold for **fl. 2,125** to the dealer J. de Vries, acting on behalf of **Lucretia Johanna van Winter** (1785–1845). It then passed into the prestigious **Six family** — one of Amsterdam's most distinguished collecting dynasties (connected to Rembrandt's famous portrait of Jan Six). The Six family held it for nearly a century, through:
- Jonkheer **Hendrik Six** (1790–1847)
- Jonkheer **Pieter Hendrik Six** (1827–1905)

This long tenure in one of the Netherlands' most illustrious private collections cemented the painting's status as a national treasure.

#### 6. **1908: The Nation Claims Its Icon**
The Rijksmuseum acquired the painting from the Six heirs in **1908** for an extraordinary **fl. 550,000** (as part of a group of 39 paintings), with crucial support from the **Vereniging Rembrandt** — the society founded specifically to keep major Dutch artworks in the country. This purchase price, compared to the fl. 175 paid in 1696, represents a roughly **3,000-fold increase** over two centuries, reflecting Vermeer's transformation from a provincial Delft master to a universal genius of Western art.

### What the Provenance Tells Us: Key Themes

| Period | Price | What it reveals |
|---|---|---|
| 1696 (Dissius) | fl. 175 | Valued locally, but Vermeer is an obscure figure nationally |
| 1701 (Rooleeuw) | fl. 320 | Steady appreciation among Amsterdam buyers |
| 1719 (Van Hoek) | fl. 126 | A dip — the "forgotten" period begins |
| 1765 (De Neufville) | fl. 560 | Dealers rediscover Vermeer's qualities |
| 1768 (Dulong) | fl. 925 | Rapid escalation — the connoisseurs' market catches fire |
| 1798 (De Bruyn) | fl. 1,550 | Elite status confirmed |
| 1813 (Muilman) | fl. 2,125 | Among the most expensive genre paintings of its era |
| 1908 (Six heirs → Rijksmuseum) | fl. 550,000 (group) | National icon; Vermeer now a household name |

**Three major insights emerge:**

1. **Vermeer was never truly "lost."** The provenance shows an unbroken chain of distinguished ownership. Even the 1719 dip was temporary. The narrative of Thoré-Bürger "discovering" Vermeer in the 1860s overstates the case — Amsterdam dealers and collectors were already driving up prices a century earlier.

2. **The painting's subject enhanced its appeal across eras.** The humble scene of a maidservant pouring milk resonated differently in different periods: as a fine *genre* piece in the 17th century, as a proto-Romantic celebration of simplicity in the 18th, and as a masterpiece of light and form in the modern era. The Rijksmuseum's own curatorial narrative describes how Vermeer "took this simple everyday activity and made it the subject of an impressive painting — the woman stands like a statue in the brightly lit room."

3. **The 1908 acquisition marked a turning point in cultural policy.** The purchase, backed by the Vereniging Rembrandt, reflects the growing conviction that certain artworks belong to the nation. Today, *The Milkmaid* hangs in the **Gallery of Honour** — the Rijksmuseum's most prestigious space — and is ranked in the museum's **Top 100**, confirming its status as one of the most celebrated paintings in the world.

The provenance of SK-A-2344 is thus far more than a list of owners: it is a 350-year record of taste, value, and national identity, tracing Vermeer's journey from a gifted local painter to a universal master.
