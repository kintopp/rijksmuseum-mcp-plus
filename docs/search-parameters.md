## Search parameters

The `search_artwork` tool accepts over 30 parameters, drawn from two backends: the online [Rijksmuseum Search API](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/) and a large set of [vocabulary data](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/docs/data-dumps/) made available by the Rijksmuseum as downloads. Search parameters from either backend can generally be combined freely; a few restrictions are noted below. At present, all searches are configured to return a maximum of 25 results by default. However, in your chat, you can can also request to see up to 100 results for a query.

### Rijksmuseum Search API  parameters

These parameters query the Rijksmuseum Search API directly. They support free-text and wildcard matching and can be combined with each other. Most of these parameters also work when combined with vocabulary-backed filters: `creator`, `type`, `material`, `technique`, `creationDate`, and `title`/`query` can all be used alongside vocabulary-backed searches. N.B. Three parameters — `description`, `aboutActor`, and `imageAvailable` — are Search API-only and will be ignored when any vocabulary-backed filter is present.

| Search Parameter | What it queries | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `query` | Artwork title | ~837K artworks. Functionally equivalent to the `title` filter below. It's provided as a convenience alias for exploratory queries where the user thinks of it as a general purpose search term. Can be combined with vocabulary-backed filters. |
| `title` | Artwork title.  | ~826K artworks with titles. Functionally equivalent to the `query` filter above but takes precedence when both are employed. Can be combined with vocabulary-backed filters. When used with vocabulary-backed filters, title search matches against all title variants (brief, full, former) — broader than the Search API, which indexes brief titles only. |
| `creator` | Artist or maker name. | ~510K artworks, ~21K unique names. Uses the museum's canonical name form (e.g. "Rembrandt van Rijn", not "Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn"). As a result, variant historical spellings may not match. Can also be combined with vocabulary-backed filters as a cross-filter. |
| `creationDate` | Year or date range of creation. | ~628K artworks with dates (3000 BCE–2025). Supports wildcards: `1642` (exact year), `164*` (1640–1649), `16*` (1600–1699). Can be combined with vocabulary-backed filters. Wildcard date ranges work on both the Search API and the vocabulary database. |
| `description` | Free-text description of the artwork. | ~292K artworks with descriptions. Cannot be combined with vocabulary-backed filters. |
| `type` | Object type.   | 4,385 terms. Values follow Rijksmuseum vocabulary terms (e.g. `painting`, `print`, `drawing`, `photograph`, `sculpture`). Can be combined with vocabulary-backed filters as a cross-filter. |
| `material` | Material or support.   | [725 terms](docs/vocabulary-materials.md). Values follow Rijksmuseum vocabulary terms (e.g. `canvas`, `paper`, `panel`, `oil paint`, `copper`). Can be combined with vocabulary-backed filters as a cross-filter. |
| `technique` | Artistic technique. | [964 terms](docs/vocabulary-techniques.md). Values follow Rijksmuseum vocabulary terms (e.g. `oil painting`, `etching`, `engraving`, `mezzotint`, `woodcut`). Can be combined with vocabulary-backed filters as a cross-filter. |
| `aboutActor` | Person depicted or referenced | ~1.3K artworks with actor references. Searches free-text references to persons. Less comprehensive than the vocabulary-backed `depictedPerson` filter (~217K artworks), which draws on controlled name authority records. Use `depictedPerson` when available. Cannot be combined with vocabulary-backed filters; silently dropped when any vocab filter is present. |
| `imageAvailable` | Whether a digital image exists | Either `true` or `false`. Useful for restricting results to artworks that can be shown with the inline, interactive viewer. ~728K artworks have a digital image available. Cannot be combined with vocabulary-backed filters; silently dropped when any vocab filter is present. |

### Rijksmuseum vocabulary parameters

These parameters search a Linked Open Data [vocabulary dataset](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/docs/data-dumps/) that maps 149,000 controlled vocabulary terms to 831,000 artworks via 12.8 million mappings. To allow this, original files were converted into an online, searchable database connected to rijksmuseum-mcp+. Its parameters can be freely combined with each other (e.g. `depictedPerson` + `productionPlace` + `creationDate: "17*"`) and with `creator`, `type`, `material`, `technique`, `creationDate` (with wildcards), `title`, `query`, from the Rijksmuseum search API and the geographic proximity parameters described in the next section. N.B. Only `description`, `aboutActor`, and `imageAvailable` (from the Rijksmuseum search API) cannot be used alongside vocabulary-backed filters.

| Search Parameter | What it queries | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `subject` | Iconographic subject labels | ~108K terms, ~722K artworks. Searches [Iconclass](https://iconclass.org/) subject terms by label text (e.g. `vanitas`, `winter landscape`, `civic guard`). Uses word-boundary matching — `cat` matches "cat" but not "Catharijnekerk". |
| `iconclass` | Iconclass notation code | ~25K notation codes. Exact match on the alphanumeric [Iconclass](https://iconclass.org/) notation (e.g. `73D82` for the Crucifixion, `45(+26)` for civic guard pieces). More precise than `subject` label search. |
| `depictedPerson` | Named person depicted | ~60K persons, ~217K artworks. Searches controlled name authority records for persons represented in the artwork (e.g. `Willem van Oranje`, `Maria Stuart`). More comprehensive than `aboutActor` because it uses the structured vocabulary rather than free-text matching. |
| `depictedPlace` | Named place depicted | 20,689 places. Searches controlled place names for locations shown in the artwork (e.g. `Amsterdam`, `Batavia`). Part of a shared geocoded place vocabulary (20,828 locations with coordinates from [Getty TGN](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/), [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/), and the [World Historical Gazetteer](https://whgazetteer.org/)). Distinct from `productionPlace` — a painting *depicting* Amsterdam may have been made in Haarlem. Place identifications reflect the museum's cataloguing and may occasionally be imprecise or outdated — verify against artwork details when precision matters. |
| `productionPlace` | Place where the work was made | 9,002 places. Searches controlled place names for production locations (e.g. `Delft`, `Antwerp`, `Kyoto`). Same geocoded place vocabulary as `depictedPlace`. Production place data reflects the museum's cataloguing at the time of the data harvest and may not always be precise — some entries use regional or approximate attributions (e.g. "Netherlands" rather than a specific city). |
| `birthPlace` | Artist's place of birth. Derived from EDM creator records in the OAI-PMH harvest.  | ~2K places, ~196K artworks. Searches biographical place data for the creator's birth location (e.g. `Leiden`, `Haarlem`). Search-only: not returned by `get_artwork_details` (use it to *find* artists from a place, then examine their works individually). |
| `deathPlace` | Artist's place of death | ~1.3K places, ~180K artworks. Searches biographical place data for the creator's death location (e.g. `Amsterdam`, `Paris`). Useful for tracking artist migration patterns — compare `birthPlace: "Antwerp"` with `deathPlace: "Amsterdam"` to find Flemish artists who moved north. |
| `profession` | Artist's profession | [600 terms](docs/vocabulary-professions.md), bilingual (English and Dutch). Examples: `painter`, `draughtsman`, `printmaker`, `photographer`. Try the Dutch term if English returns no results. Search-only: not returned by `get_artwork_details`. Useful for finding artists by role rather than name — e.g. `profession: "architect"` with `productionPlace: "Amsterdam"`. |
| `collectionSet` | Curated collection set name | [192 sets](docs/vocabulary-collection-sets.md) defined by Rijksmuseum curators — thematic groupings, exhibition selections, and scholarly collections (e.g. `Rembrandt`, `Japanese`, `Delftware`). Matches by name substring. |
| `license` | Rights/license designation | `publicdomain` ([Public Domain Mark 1.0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/) — 728K works), `zero` ([CC0 1.0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) — 1.7K works), `InC` ([In Copyright](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/) — 101K works). Uses [RightsStatements.org](https://rightsstatements.org/) and [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org) URIs. |
| `inscription` | Transcribed text on the object surface.  | Full-text search across ~500K artworks with transcribed inscriptions. Covers signatures, dates, dedications, mottoes, stamps, and labels physically present on the object. Examples: `fecit` (Latin "made [this]"), `Rembrandt f.`, `anno 1642`. |
| `provenance` | Ownership history text. | Full-text search across ~48K artworks with recorded provenance. Covers auction records, dealer transactions, collection transfers, and restitution notes. Examples: `Napoleon`, `Six`, `Rothschild`, `Goudstikker`. Coverage is weighted toward paintings and major works. |
| `creditLine` | Acquisition mode and acknowledgement.   | Full-text search across ~358K artworks with credit lines. Records how the museum acquired the work — purchase, bequest, gift, loan, state allocation. Examples: `purchase`, `bequest`, `Vereniging Rembrandt`, `Drucker`. |
| `curatorialNarrative` | Curatorial narrative (museum wall text).  | Full-text search across ~14K artworks with curatorial narratives. Harvested from the Linked Art `subject_of` field — distinct from the Search API's `description` parameter which queries a different, broader text. These are interpretive, art-historical texts written by museum curators — equivalent to the wall labels in the galleries. |
| `productionRole` | Role in production | [176 terms](docs/vocabulary-production-roles.md), bilingual. Specifies the role an actor played in creating the work — distinct from `profession` (what the person *was*) vs. production role (what they *did* for this specific work). Key terms: `print maker` (382K mappings), `publisher` (185K), `printer` (67K), `after painting by` (46K), `after design by` (60K).  |
| `minHeight` / `maxHeight` | Height range in centimetres. | Numeric range filter on structured dimensions. Values are in centimetres. |
| `minWidth` / `maxWidth` | Width range in centimetres. | Numeric range filter on structured dimensions. Values are in centimetres. |

### Geographic proximity search

These parameters find artworks related to places near a given location. They search across both depicted and production places (see above) using coordinates from 20,828 geocoded places. These searches can be combined with any vocabulary-backed parameter and with `creator`, `type`, `material`, `technique`, `creationDate`, and `title`/`query` from the Rijksmuseum backend. N.B. Geo parameters cannot be combined in the same search with `description`, `aboutActor`, or `imageAvailable`. 

N.B. The latitude/longitude coordinates were derived from the authority file IDs (Getty TGN, Wikidata, GeoNames, World Historical Gazetteer) already present in the Rijksmuseum's vocabulary dataset. However, these coordinates may not always align exactly with the location the museum intended — particularly for historical place names that have shifted boundaries or been renamed. Place identifications also reflect the museum's cataloguing, which can be approximate. As a precaution, approximately 5,500 places with uncertain location data have been witheld from the online database pending further review. 

| Search Parameter | What it queries | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `nearPlace` | Artworks related to places near a named location | Searches both depicted and production places within a radius of the named location (e.g. `nearPlace: "Leiden"`). 20,828 geocoded places with coordinates from [Getty TGN](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/), [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/), and the [World Historical Gazetteer](https://whgazetteer.org/). |
| `nearLat` | Latitude for coordinate-based proximity search | Use with `nearLon` as an alternative to `nearPlace` for searching near arbitrary locations (e.g. `nearLat: 52.37, nearLon: 4.89`). Range: -90 to 90. If both `nearLat`/`nearLon` and `nearPlace` are provided, coordinates take precedence. |
| `nearLon` | Longitude for coordinate-based proximity search | Use with `nearLat`. Range: -180 to 180. |
| `nearPlaceRadius` | Search radius in kilometres | Default: 25 km, range: 0.1–500 km. Controls the geographic scope of `nearPlace` and `nearLat`/`nearLon` queries. |

### Artwork detail fields

`get_artwork_details` returns 24 metadata categories for a single artwork. Nearly all are also searchable collection-wide via corresponding `search_artwork` parameters. N.B. The exceptions are identifiers (object number, persistent ID, external IDs), current location, web page, related objects, and bibliography count. See the [full field reference](docs/metadata-categories.md) for details on each category and its search counterpart.

| Field | What it contains | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Object number (`objectNumber`) | Museum inventory number (e.g. `SK-C-5`) | The primary collection identifier. Format encodes the collection: `SK` = paintings (*Schilderijen Kabinet*), `RP` = prints (*Rijksprentenkabinet*), `BK` = sculpture/applied art (*Beeldhouwkunst*), `NG` = modern acquisitions (*Nagelaten Gift*). |
| Persistent identifier (`persistentId`) | Stable [Handle](https://www.handle.net/) URI | Permanent citation link (e.g. `http://hdl.handle.net/10934/RM0001.COLLECT.5216`). Unlike web URLs, Handle URIs are guaranteed to resolve long-term. Use in publications and bibliographies. |
| External identifiers (`externalIds`) | All cataloguing identifiers | Includes the object number and any additional identifiers assigned during cataloguing. |
| Title variants (`titles`) | All known titles with language and type.  | Each entry has a language (`en` or `nl` — the collection is strictly bilingual) and qualifier (`brief`, `full`, or `former`). Up to 6 variants per artwork. The brief English title is the primary display title; ~71% of artworks have Dutch-only titles. Note: the Search API's `query`/`title` parameters only match against brief titles. |
| Curatorial narrative (`curatorialNarrative`) | Museum wall text in English and/or Dutch.  | Interpretive art-historical context written by curators. Harvested from the Linked Art `subject_of` field. Distinct from `description` (Search API). |
| Production details (`production`) | Structured creator, role, and place data | Each participant entry includes `name` (resolved label), `role` (e.g. "painter"), `place` (e.g. "Amsterdam"), and `actorUri` (link to the artist's Linked Art record). Creator, place, and role are individually searchable via the filters above; the structured production record provides the full context. |
| Object types (`objectTypes`) | What the object is, with authority links | Resolved vocabulary terms (e.g. "painting", "print") with equivalents linking to [Getty AAT](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/) and [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Also searchable via the `type` filter above. |
| Materials (`materials`) | What the object is made of, with authority links | Resolved vocabulary terms (e.g. "oil paint", "canvas") with AAT and Wikidata equivalents. Also searchable via the `material` filter above. |
| Technique statement (`techniqueStatement`) | Free-text technique description.  |  |
| Dimension statement (`dimensionStatement`) | Human-readable dimensions text.   | For numeric filtering, use `minHeight`/`maxHeight`/`minWidth`/`maxWidth` above. |
| Structured dimensions (`dimensions`) | Numeric dimension values | Each entry has a resolved type label (e.g. "height"), numeric `value`, `unit` (cm, mm, kg, g, m), and optional `note`.  |
| Subjects (`subjects`) | Iconographic annotations | Three components: `iconclass` ([Iconclass](https://iconclass.org/) concepts), `depictedPersons` (named individuals), `depictedPlaces` (geographic locations). Each entry is a resolved term with `label`, `id`, and `equivalents` linking to Iconclass, AAT, or Wikidata URIs. Derived from the Linked Art VisualItem layer. Searchable via `subject`, `iconclass`, `depictedPerson`, and `depictedPlace` filters above. |
| Provenance (`provenance`) | Ownership history text.   | Searchable via the `provenance` filter above; the full text is returned here. |
| Credit line (`creditLine`) | Acquisition acknowledgement.   | Searchable via the `creditLine` filter above; the full text is returned here. |
| Inscriptions (`inscriptions`) | Text transcribed from the object surface.   | May include multiple entries (signatures, dates, labels, stamps). Searchable via the `inscription` filter above. |
| License (`license`) | Rights/license URI | CC0, Public Domain Mark, or In Copyright. Also searchable via the `license` filter above. |
| Collection sets (`collectionSets`, `collectionSetLabels`) | Curatorial groupings | Raw vocabulary URIs and resolved English labels with AAT and Wikidata equivalents. Also searchable via `collectionSet` above and discoverable via `list_curated_sets`. |
| Current location (`location`) | Gallery and room within the museum | Physical location identifier parsed from Linked Art `current_location`. Indicates whether the work is currently on display and where. Not all artworks have location data; the field may be absent for works in storage or on loan. |
| Web page (`webPage`) | Rijksmuseum website URL | Link to the artwork's page on [rijksmuseum.nl](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection). |
| Related objects (`relatedObjects`) | Links to associated artworks | Each entry has a `relationship` label (in English) and an `objectUri` pointing to the related Linked Art record. It is possible to retrieve full details of the related object. |
| Bibliography count (`bibliographyCount`) | Number of scholarly references | A count only — use `get_artwork_bibliography` for full citations. Major works can have 100+ references (e.g. *The Night Watch*). |
