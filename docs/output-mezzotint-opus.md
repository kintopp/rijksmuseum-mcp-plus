## Mezzotint in the Dutch Republic: The Rijksmuseum's Holdings

### Overview of the Collection

The Rijksmuseum holds an extraordinary **7,792 mezzotints**, making it one of the world's premier repositories for studying this tonal intaglio technique. The data reveals a remarkably clear arc of rise, flourishing, and decline.

### 1. The Invention and Earliest Phase (1640s–1650s)

Mezzotint was invented around 1642 by **Ludwig von Siegen** (1609–c.1680), a German-born soldier and amateur printmaker. The Rijksmuseum owns **4 prints by Von Siegen himself**, including some of the technique's earliest surviving examples:

| Object | Title | Date |
|--------|-------|------|
| **RP-P-1907-2241A** | *Portret van Elisabeth Stuart* | **1643** |
| **RP-P-1906-3625** | *Portret van koningin Maria Stuart* | 1642–1680 |
| **RP-P-1891-A-16290** | *Portret van keizer Ferdinand III* | 1654 |
| **RP-P-1907-2243** | *Portret van paus Alexander VII* | 1657 |

The 1643 portrait of Elisabeth Stuart is significant — Von Siegen sent an impression to the landgrave of Hesse, calling it a new invention. These are among the **rarest and most historically important prints in the collection**.

In the 1650s decade, the collection records only **800 works** — production was still tiny and experimental.

### 2. The First Great Dutch Practitioner: Wallerant Vaillant (1658–1677)

**Wallerant Vaillant** (1623–1677) was the first major artist to adopt mezzotint systematically in the Dutch Republic. Prince Rupert of the Palatinate (whose mezzotints interestingly returned 0 results under that name) reportedly shared the technique with Vaillant in Amsterdam. The Rijksmuseum holds **77 mezzotints by Vaillant** — the largest surviving body of his work in a single institution.

Key example: **RP-P-H-1077**, *David met het hoofd van Goliath* (1658–1677), a pure mezzotint (334 × 398 mm) that is part of the museum's "Meesterwerken op papier: Het licht en het donker" (Masterworks on Paper: Light and Dark) curated set. Vaillant exploited mezzotint's unique ability to build forms from velvety dark to luminous highlight — perfectly suited to the Caravaggist drama of this subject.

### 3. The Golden Age of Dutch Mezzotint (1660s–1690s)

The technique exploded in popularity during these decades, as the collection numbers clearly show:

| Decade | Mezzotints in Collection |
|--------|--------------------------|
| 1650s | ~800 |
| **1660s** | **460** |
| **1670s** | **1,025** |
| **1680s** | **645** |
| **1690s** | **449** |

The **1670s represent the absolute peak**, with over 1,000 works — an era when Dutch mezzotinters dominated the European print market.

#### Leading Dutch Practitioners (ranked by Rijksmuseum holdings):

| Artist | Works | Active Period | Speciality |
|--------|-------|---------------|------------|
| **Jacob Gole** | **140** | c.1680–1724 (Amsterdam) | Genre, political prints, reproductions |
| **Wallerant Vaillant** | **77** | 1658–1677 | Biblical subjects, portraits, after Old Masters |
| **Aert Schouman** | **68** | 18th c. | Birds, natural history |
| **Jan van Somer** | **52** | c.1660s–1700 | Portraits, genre |
| **Cornelis Dusart** | **47** | 1679–1704 (Haarlem) | Genre, political satire |
| **Jan Verkolje** | **29** | c.1670s–1690s | Portraits, allegory |
| **Pieter Schenk (I)** | **28** | 1670–1713 (Amsterdam) | Genre, portraits, hand-colored mezzotints |
| **Abraham Bloteling** | **16** | 1665–1690 | Religious subjects, Rembrandt reproductions |
| **Nicolaas Verkolje** | **12** | c.1690s–1730s | Portraits, genre |

**Jacob Gole** emerges as the single most represented Dutch mezzotinter, with **140 works**. His prints were produced in Amsterdam and included both original genre compositions and politically charged prints — such as the series commemorating the 1695 capture of Namur (e.g., **RP-P-BI-7357**, *De man met een vuurpijl*), executed as proof impressions showing the medium at its most refined.

**Cornelis Dusart**, working in Haarlem, is notably represented by genre subjects and the same 1695 Namur celebration series — his *De vrolijke patriot* (**RP-P-BI-7283**) shows a dancing man with a roemer against the backdrop of the fortress of Namur, a powerful example of mezzotint used for political propaganda.

### 4. Technical Innovations Visible in the Collection

The collection reveals how Dutch practitioners pushed mezzotint beyond its original limitations:

- **Hand-coloring**: Both Pieter Schenk's *Bordeel scène* (**RP-P-2024-55**, "met de hand ingekleurde mezzotint") and Bloteling's *Temptation of St. Anthony* (**RP-P-1992-130**, "mezzotint en gravure, met de hand gekleurd op gevernist papier") show the Dutch innovation of hand-coloring mezzotints on varnished paper — essentially creating print-based approximations of painting.
- **Mixed technique**: Bloteling's St. Anthony combines mezzotint with **engraved lines** ("mezzotint en gravure"), a hybrid approach that added definition to the soft tonal gradations.

### 5. Decline: The 18th and 19th Centuries

The numbers tell a story of dramatic decline in the Dutch Republic even as the technique migrated to England:

| Century/Period | Mezzotints | Notes |
|----------------|------------|-------|
| **1600s total** | **3,460** | The Dutch golden age of mezzotint |
| **1700s total** | **3,408** | Still strong, but increasingly English-dominated |
| **1800s total** | **446** | Steep decline — lithography and photography displace mezzotint |
| **1900s total** | **84** | Niche revival among artist-printmakers |

Several factors drove the decline:
1. **The British monopoly**: By the 1700s, English mezzotinters (well represented in the Rijksmuseum — Isaac Beckett, Valentine Green, James Watson, William Baillie all appear) had made London the center of the trade. The Dutch role shifted from innovators to importers.
2. **Technological displacement**: Aquatint (invented c.1768) offered similar tonal effects more cheaply; lithography (c.1796) was faster and more versatile; photography (1839) ultimately rendered reproductive mezzotint obsolete.
3. **The 19th-century remnant** (446 works) includes mostly English reproductive mezzotints, not Dutch originals.
4. **The 20th-century fragment** (84 works) includes revival efforts like Peter Vilhelm Ilsted's *A Rainy Day* (**RP-P-1992-75**, 1871–1933), reflecting the medium's survival as an art-for-art's-sake practice.

### Conclusion

The Rijksmuseum's mezzotint collection is a nearly complete archive of the technique's history. It demonstrates that the Dutch Republic was the **cradle of artistic mezzotint** — Von Siegen's invention was refined here by Vaillant, commercialized by Gole and Schenk, and used for genre, portraiture, and political propaganda by Dusart and the Verkoljes. The collection's chronological distribution — peaking dramatically in the 1670s with over 1,000 works, holding strong through the 1690s, and then declining sharply after 1800 — mirrors the technique's historical arc with remarkable precision. The Dutch effectively invented the medium's artistic vocabulary before ceding its commercial future to England.
