Perfect! This 1600 landscape drawing is crucial - it shows Goltzius was already working in different media at the turn of the century. Now let me compile my analysis based on this comprehensive data.

## Analysis: Goltzius's Transition from Engraving to Painting

Based on the Rijksmuseum collection data, I can provide a detailed answer about Goltzius's transition and whether it supports the traditional narrative of a "sudden conversion."

### Key Chronological Evidence:

**Engraving Activity:**
- **Last firmly dated engravings: 1597** - A series of eight prints on litigation and greed (RP-P-1886-A-10435 through RP-P-1886-A-10441)
- **c. 1598-1600**: Only 2 engravings with broad date ranges (including the unfinished "Adoration of the Magi," RP-P-OB-10.028)
- **1599**: Zero dated engravings
- **1600s (entire decade)**: Zero engravings found when searching for works dated 160*

This is striking: out of 177 engravings in the collection, **none are firmly dated after 1597**.

**Painting Activity:**
- **1590s**: Zero paintings
- **1609**: First dated painting - "Dying Adonis" (SK-A-1284), signed "HG 1609"
- **1613**: "Vertumnus and Pomona" (SK-A-2217)
- **1616**: "Lot and his Daughters" (SK-A-4866), completed one year before his death in 1617

**Drawing Activity in the Transition Period:**
- **1600**: Landscape drawing "Ruïne van huis Brederode" (RP-T-1879-A-67) - showing interest in naturalistic observation
- **1605**: Large preparatory drawing "Geboorte van Adonis" (RP-T-00-563, 456 x 606 mm) - clearly a compositional study for painting
- **1606**: Portrait studies continue

### Does the Evidence Support a "Sudden Conversion"?

**The answer is: Yes and No**

**YES - The break is remarkably sharp:**
1. **1597-1598 marks a clear caesura**: Engraving production essentially ceases after 1597
2. **A full decade gap**: No paintings until 1609, suggesting he wasn't actively painting in oil before 1600
3. **The timing aligns with his Italian journey (1590-1591)**: Though paintings don't appear until much later, the inspiration from seeing Italian masterworks likely planted seeds for this transformation

**NO - There are transitional indicators:**
1. **Drawing continued throughout**: The 1600 landscape and 1605 Adonis composition show continuous artistic development
2. **Nine-year lag between abandoning engraving (1597) and first dated painting (1609)** suggests experimentation rather than instant conversion
3. **Preparatory work visible**: The 1605 drawing demonstrates he was preparing painted compositions well before completing canvases
4. **Age factor**: Goltzius was born in 1558, making him around 40 in 1597-98 and 51 when the first painting appears. This suggests deliberation rather than impulsive abandonment of his printmaking mastery

### The Traditional Narrative Reconsidered:

The collection evidence **partially supports but significantly nuances** the traditional art historical narrative. Rather than a "sudden conversion" around 1600, we see:

1. **A decisive cessation of engraving by 1597-98** (perhaps related to hand problems, as some sources suggest)
2. **A significant experimental period (c. 1598-1608)** during which Goltzius worked primarily in drawing and perhaps began teaching himself to paint
3. **Public emergence as a painter only from 1609** when he was confident enough to sign and date works

The Rijksmuseum's three paintings (1609, 1613, 1616) represent only the **final, successful phase** of painting activity, not the full story of transition. The narrative of "sudden conversion" may reflect when paintings became **visible** rather than when the transition actually **began**.

This aligns with Goltzius's personality as a perfectionist and virtuoso - he likely wouldn't have exhibited paintings until he achieved mastery in the new medium, accounting for the apparent gap between abandoning engraving and producing signed paintings.
