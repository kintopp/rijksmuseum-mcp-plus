### Breakdown by Object Type

| Type | Count |
|------|-------|
| **Prints (etchings)** | 74 |
| **Drawings** | 2 |
| **Paintings** | 1 |
| **Total** | **77** |

This is one of the world's most important concentrations of Segers' work. Given that only about 183 impressions from his roughly 54 etching plates are known to survive worldwide, the Rijksmuseum holds a remarkable share.

| 1 | **SK-A-3120** | *River Valley* | c. 1626–1630 |

Oil on panel, 30 × 53.5 cm. It reflects the Flemish landscape tradition of Pieter Bruegel — high vantage point, rocky mountains, and subtle colour contrasts for depth.

### Key Observations

1. **Extraordinary experimental techniques**: Segers printed on **paper, linen, and cotton**, using prepared coloured grounds. He made **counterproofs**, printed with **oil instead of ink**, overpainted prints with **body colour and oil paint**, and was likely the **first European artist to print on Far Eastern paper** (RP-P-H-OB-799) — more than 20 years before Rembrandt.

2. **Unique impressions**: Because Segers treated each impression differently — varying ink colour, paper preparation, and overpainting — many are essentially unique works of art, which explains the high number of impressions from the same plates.

3. **Multiple states per plate**: He frequently reworked plates between impressions, adding stipples, drypoint, and lift-ground etching to transform compositions.

4. **Provenance**: Many works trace back to the collection of **Michiel Hinloopen (1619–1708)**, bequeathed to the City of Amsterdam and on loan to the Rijksmuseum since 1885.

5. **Date range**: The works span c. 1615–1633, with the earliest being explorations of local Dutch landscape (Brederode, Rijnsburg, Amersfoort) and the latest being the ambitious *Tobias and the Angel* and *Lamentation of Christ*.

6. **Rembrandt connection**: Rembrandt owned one of Segers' plates (*Tobias and the Angel*) and reworked it into his own *Flight into Egypt* — four impressions of which (RP-P-OB-114 through -116, RP-P-1961-1016) are also in the Rijksmuseum.
