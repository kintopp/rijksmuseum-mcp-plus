## Goltzius's Transition from Engraving to Painting: What the Rijksmuseum Collection Reveals

### The Traditional Narrative

Karel van Mander's *Schilder-Boeck* (1604) famously records that Goltzius took up painting relatively suddenly around 1600, after decades as the most virtuosic engraver in Northern Europe. This has long been framed as a dramatic "conversion" — the master printmaker laying down the burin for the brush.

### The Collection Evidence: By the Numbers

The Rijksmuseum holds **232 works** by Hendrick Goltzius, distributed as follows:

| Medium | Count | Date Range |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Prints** | **183** | c. 1578–c. 1604 |
| **Drawings** | **44** | c. 1578–1610 |
| **Paintings** | **3** | 1609–1616 |

The three paintings are:
1. **Dying Adonis** (SK-A-1284) — signed and dated **1609**, oil on canvas, 76.5 × 76.5 cm
2. **Vertumnus and Pomona** (SK-A-2217) — signed and dated **1613**, oil on canvas, 90 × 149.5 cm
3. **Lot and his Daughters** (SK-A-4866) — signed and dated **1616**, oil on canvas, 140 × 204 cm (a "Top 1000" Rijksmuseum highlight)

### Does the Evidence Support a "Sudden Conversion"?

**Partially — but it's more nuanced than the traditional story.** Several lines of evidence emerge:

#### 1. The Print Production Does Stop Abruptly
Searching for Goltzius prints dated to the **1600s** (160*) returns **zero results** in the Rijksmuseum. His last firmly datable prints cluster around **1597–1598** (the allegorical series on litigation, RP-P-1886-A-10435 through 10441), with one print straddling the transition: *Zorg van God voor de zijnen* (RP-P-1944-1439, dated "1598–1604"). This is consistent with a cessation of engraving activity around 1600.

#### 2. A Crucial Unfinished Print
Perhaps the most telling object is **The Adoration of the Magi** (RP-P-OB-10.028), dated c. 1598–1600 and explicitly described as **"onvoltooide compositie"** (unfinished composition) — only four figures completed. This is one of Goltzius's famous *Meesterstukjes* in the manner of Lucas van Leyden, and its unfinished state may literally mark the moment he set down the burin. The print lists both **Lucas van Leyden** and **Titian** as "inspirators," underscoring Goltzius's engagement with painterly models even while still engraving.

#### 3. The Drawing Practice Bridges the Gap
The drawings tell a different, more **gradual** story. While prints cluster in the 1580s–1590s, drawings span the entire career **without interruption**:
- **1595–1605**: *Study for the Christ Child* (RP-T-1898-A-3511), in red and black chalk — a study that could serve either a print or a painting
- **1595–1605**: *Five Officers, study for a militia banquet* (RP-T-1884-A-338), in black and red chalk with white paint on brown cartridge paper — note the **painterly** medium (white heightening on prepared paper)
- **1605**: *Birth of Adonis* (RP-T-00-563) — pen in brown with **white paint on grey prepared paper**, an Ovidian subject he would revisit in the 1609 painting *Dying Adonis*
- **1606**: *Study of a Man's Head in the Style of Dürer* (RP-T-1921-478(R))
- **1610**: *Bust of an Old Man* (RP-T-1884-A-337) — a nearly life-size chalk study contemporaneous with the paintings

#### 4. Painterly Techniques Appear Before Painting
The transitional drawings reveal Goltzius **already working in painterly modes** before his first dated oil paintings. The use of **white paint on grey prepared paper** (RP-T-00-563, 1605) and **chalk with white heightening on toned cartridge paper** (RP-T-1884-A-338, c. 1595–1605) suggests a gradual shift toward tonal modeling and coloristic effects — essentially *painting with drawing materials*.

#### 5. The Paintings Themselves Show Continuity, Not Rupture
The mythological subject matter of the paintings — Adonis, Vertumnus and Pomona, Lot — is **entirely consistent** with Goltzius's print oeuvre themes (Ovidian mythology, biblical narrative). The curatorial narrative for *Lot and his Daughters* (SK-A-4866) highlights the "striking contrast between sunburned skin and smooth skin" — effects of color and light that his engraving virtuosity in modeling flesh had long anticipated. The 1605 drawing *Birth of Adonis* and the 1609 painting *Dying Adonis* even share the same mythological cycle, suggesting continuity of artistic interest across the media transition.

### Conclusion

The Rijksmuseum collection **partially supports but significantly complicates** the "sudden conversion" narrative:

- **Yes**: The print production effectively **ceases around 1598–1600**, dramatically confirmed by the unfinished *Adoration* engraving, and no prints appear after the early 1600s. The first signed painting doesn't appear until **1609** — a gap of roughly a decade.
- **But**: The **drawings** fill that gap, revealing a gradual technical migration toward painterly effects (prepared papers, white heightening, chalk mixtures) throughout the late 1590s and 1600s. The transition was not so much a "conversion" as a **continuum**, with drawing as the mediating practice between burin and brush.
- The **9-year gap** between the last datable prints (c. 1600) and the first Rijksmuseum painting (1609) also reminds us that Goltzius's earliest paintings (known from other collections to date from c. 1600–1603) are not represented here, so the Rijksmuseum's holdings may slightly exaggerate the delay.

In sum, the collection evidence suggests that **Goltzius stopped engraving rather abruptly, but took up painting gradually** — making the traditional narrative a half-truth that collapses a complex, media-crossing creative evolution into a single dramatic moment.
