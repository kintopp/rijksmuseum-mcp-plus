## Rembrandt in the Rijksmuseum: A Fundamentally Graphic Practice

### The Numbers

A breakdown by medium of works attributed to Rembrandt van Rijn in the Rijksmuseum collection:

| Medium | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Prints** | 459 | 84.2% |
| **Drawings** | 64 | 11.7% |
| **Paintings** | 20 | 3.7% |
| **Other** | 2 | 0.4% |
| **Total** | 545 | 100% |

### The Perception Gap

These figures reveal a striking disconnect between Rembrandt's popular image and the reality of the Rijksmuseum's holdings. The museum holds **23 times more prints than paintings** by Rembrandt. Prints account for over 84% of his works in the collection, yet public discourse overwhelmingly centres on a handful of iconic canvases.

### The Paintings: Icons of the Canon

The 20 paintings include some of the most famous works in Western art:

- **The Night Watch** (SK-C-5, 1642) — the 379.5 x 453.5 cm militia piece, with 111 bibliography entries, on permanent display in its own dedicated gallery
- **Self-portrait as the Apostle Paul** (SK-A-4050, 1661) — a Top 100 work with 21 bibliography entries, showing the artist at 55 in biblical guise
- **The Jewish Bride** (SK-C-216) — 42 bibliography entries, one of Rembrandt's most studied late works

These paintings attract disproportionate scholarly attention and visitor traffic. The Night Watch alone has generated more published scholarship (111 entries) than the entire print collection combined is likely to attract for any individual sheet.

### The Prints: The Core of Rembrandt's Practice

The 459 prints represent the true breadth of Rembrandt's daily artistic output. The earliest, **Self-portrait with Curly Hair** (RP-P-OB-1, c. 1630), is a tiny etching just 58 x 52 mm — smaller than a playing card. It bears the monogram "RHL" (Rembrandt Harmenszoon of Leiden), dating it to his pre-Amsterdam years.

Rembrandt's etchings were his laboratory: he experimented with light effects, tested compositions, and developed the tonal range that would define his painted work. The Rijksmuseum's print room (Rijksprentenkabinet) holds one of the world's finest collections of these works, including multiple states of key plates that document his iterative process.

### The Drawings: Between Sketch and Study

The 64 drawings occupy the most intimate register of Rembrandt's practice — quick studies from life, compositional sketches, and preparatory drawings that reveal his working method before the formality of a copper plate or canvas.

### Why This Matters

The 84/12/4 ratio (prints/drawings/paintings) challenges several common assumptions:

1. **Rembrandt was fundamentally a printmaker.** His daily practice centred on the etching needle, not the brush. The paintings, however magnificent, were the exception rather than the rule.

2. **The museum's identity is built on a statistical minority.** The Night Watch Gallery, the self-portraits, the Jewish Bride — these define the Rijksmuseum's brand, yet they represent less than 4% of its Rembrandt holdings.

3. **Access patterns are inverted.** The paintings hang in public galleries; the prints and drawings are in the study collection, accessible primarily to specialists. The works most visitors see are the least representative of Rembrandt's output.

4. **Art historical emphasis follows display, not data.** Survey courses and popular books focus on the paintings because those are the works on permanent view. A data-driven approach to the collection reveals a different Rembrandt — one who spent most of his career hunched over a copper plate in his workshop.

This reframing has pedagogical value: it forces students to confront the gap between canonical reputation and actual practice, and to ask why certain media are valued over others in the construction of artistic genius.
