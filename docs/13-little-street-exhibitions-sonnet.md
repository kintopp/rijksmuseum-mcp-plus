Based on my search of the Rijksmuseum's collection data for Vermeer's "The Little Street" (object number SK-A-2860), I cannot find specific information about how many times this painting has been lent to exhibitions outside the Rijksmuseum.

The available data includes:

1. **Current Location**: The painting is displayed in the Gallery of Honour (Eregalerij) of the Rijksmuseum's main building

2. **Provenance**: Detailed ownership history from the 17th century through its donation to the museum in 1921 by H.W.A. Deterding

3. **Bibliography**: 21 scholarly references, including several exhibition catalogues that suggest the painting has been featured in exhibitions, such as:
   - "Vermeer and the Delft style" (1984)
   - "Johannes Vermeer" (1995-1996, The Hague)
   - "Vermeer and the Delft school" (2001)
   - "Vermeer: il secolo d'oro dell'arte olandese" (2012, Italy)

However, the Rijksmuseum's collection database does not provide a comprehensive exhibition loan history or a count of how many times the painting has traveled. This type of information would typically be maintained in the museum's internal registrar records but is not publicly accessible through their digital collection interface.

To obtain this specific information, you would need to contact the Rijksmuseum directly or consult published exhibition histories and loan records in art historical literature.
