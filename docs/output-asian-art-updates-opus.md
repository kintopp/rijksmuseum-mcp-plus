## Recent Catalogue Updates to Rijksmuseum Asian Art Holdings

### Scale of the update effort

The data strongly indicates a **massive, ongoing catalogue revision** across the Rijksmuseum's Asian art collections. Since January 2025, the change-tracking system reports:

| Curated Set | Set ID | Total Objects | Records Updated Since Jan 2025 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Japan (collectie)** | `26134` | 7,735 | **7,735** (100%) |
| **China (collectie)** | `261132` | 4,262 | **4,262** (100%) |
| **Japanse textielsjablonen** | `26169` | (separate set) | — |

In other words, **every single record** in both the Japan and China collection sets has been touched since January 2025 — 11,997 records combined. These updates occurred in concentrated batches (many records stamped on the same day, e.g. January 26–28, 2026), suggesting a systematic, programmatic catalogue overhaul rather than piecemeal edits.

### What was updated? A closer look at specific objects

I examined four recently modified Asian art records in detail:

#### 1. **Hashimoto Kansetsu, *Landscape in China*** (`AK-MAK-1830`, c. 1930)
- **Updated:** 28 Jan 2026
- **Credit line now reads:** *"On loan from the Royal Asian Art Society in The Netherlands (gift of Chris van Otterloo and Maartje Draak Fonds, 2023)"*
- **Bilingual curatorial narrative** has been added in both English and Dutch, explaining Kansetsu's interest in China, the Song-dynasty inspiration, and the tiny horsemen motif.
- **Authority links** (VIAF, ULAN, Wikidata) are now attached to the creator record.
- **Provenance field:** still null — credit line carries the ownership history instead.

#### 2. **Western Zhou lead wine vessel (*you*)** (`AK-MAK-7`, c. 1700–800 BCE)
- **Updated:** 26 Jan 2026
- **Provenance now recorded:** *"…; donated by Dr A.F. Philips and Mrs A.H.E.M. Philips-de Jongh to the Vereniging van Vrienden der Aziatische Kunst, 1946; from whom on loan to the museum, 1972"*
- **Credit line:** *"On loan from the Royal Asian Art Society in The Netherlands (gift of A.F. Philips en A.H.E.M. Philips-de Jongh, 1946)"*
- **Curatorial narrative** in English and Dutch now specifies the period (Early Western Zhou, 1050–975 BC) and explains these lead vessels as mortuary gifts — cheaper substitutes for bronze.
- **Object types enriched** to three controlled terms: *wijnvat*, *ritual object*, and *yu* (with AAT links).
- **7 bibliography entries** are attached.

#### 3. **Northern/Southern Dynasties tomb figure** (`AK-BR-FLA-5-B`, c. 220–589)
- **Updated:** 26 Jan 2026
- Now classified under **two Asian ceramics sets** (set IDs `261223` and `260245`), indicating new thematic grouping.
- **English title refined** to *"Tomb figure in the shape of a woman with a flute[?]"* — the question mark signals curatorial caution about the instrument identification.
- **Dual dimensions** recorded (with and without the later wooden stand), showing careful physical documentation.
- **Credit line and provenance:** still null, but the Dutch narrative notes *"Bruikleen mr. R. Flaes"* (loan from Mr. R. Flaes).

#### 4. **Triple gourd vase in Japanese style** (`AK-NM-6441-A`, c. 1700–1724)
- **Detailed provenance chain now recorded:** *Jean Theodore Royer (1737–1807), The Hague → bequeathed to King William I, 1814 → Royal Cabinet of Curiosities, 1816 → transferred to the museum, 1885*
- Belongs to **both** the China and Asian ceramics sets, plus the "biografic" set — suggesting it has been linked to the Royer collector biography.
- **Rich materials breakdown:** porcelain, enamel, glaze, gold, cobalt — each with AAT vocabulary links.
- **Related objects** cross-linked (the pair vase `AK-NM-6441-B` and another variant).

### Patterns and conclusions

1. **Provenance is being systematically enriched.** The Royer vase and Zhou wine vessel now carry full ownership chains. Many older records (like the tomb figure) still lack formal provenance, but credit lines are being standardized to identify the lending body (especially the Royal Asian Art Society / *Vereniging van Vrienden der Aziatische Kunst*).

2. **Bilingual curatorial narratives** are being added across the Asian art holdings, a significant interpretive enhancement.

3. **Controlled vocabulary and authority linking** (AAT, VIAF, ULAN, Wikidata) is being applied consistently — particularly for object types (e.g., *yu* vessels) and materials.

4. **New thematic sets** like "Asian ceramics" (appearing twice with different set IDs — `260245` and `261223`) suggest the museum is building new cross-collection groupings for research and display.

5. **The update is comprehensive but ongoing.** Some records have fully fleshed-out provenance while others still show `null` — the 100% touch rate likely reflects a batch metadata migration or system update, with detailed curatorial enrichment following in waves.

In short: **yes, the Rijksmuseum has recently undertaken a sweeping update of its Asian art catalogue**, affecting all ~12,000 records in the Japan and China collections. The changes include new provenance data, bilingual narratives, refined attributions (with cautious hedging where appropriate), enriched vocabulary links, and new thematic groupings — a substantial scholarly and digital infrastructure improvement.
