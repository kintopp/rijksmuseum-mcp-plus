## Dutch Maritime Trade in the Rijksmuseum: Curated Groupings and Key Objects

The Rijksmuseum has indeed curated **multiple collection sets** directly related to Dutch maritime trade. While none is titled simply "maritime trade," the museum approaches this vast topic through at least **nine interlocking groupings** that collectively tell the story of the Dutch trading empire. Here they are, organized thematically:

---

### 1. 🚢 **Maritieme Collecties** (Maritime Collections) — Set `261205` · **259 objects**
This is the broadest grouping, encompassing navigational instruments (octants, sextants, compasses), ship fittings, and objects of naval ceremony. Standout objects include:

- **Crown for the King of Ardra** (`NG-NM-816-A`, c. 1664) — A copper, velvet, and glass crown intended as a diplomatic gift to the king of a West African kingdom, explicitly linked to the **slave trade**. Its curatorial text states: *"This crown was intended as a diplomatic gift to the king of Ardra to promote trade in enslaved Africans."* It belongs to the **Top 1000** collection.
- **Commander's Baton of Admiral de Ruyter** (`NG-NM-10402`) — A diamond-studded tortoiseshell baton presented by the Spanish Viceroy of Naples in 1676, shortly before De Ruyter's death.
- **Letter Pouch of De Ruyter** (`NG-NM-10408`) — Possibly a diplomatic gift from North African rulers, linked to securing Mediterranean trade routes against privateers.
- **Coconut Cup from Piet Heyn's Capture of the Spanish Silver Fleet** (`NG-NM-10815`, c. 1585–1600) — Connected to the legendary 1628 WIC raid on the Spanish treasure fleet off Cuba.

### 2. 🔱 **Rotterdamse V.O.C. serie** (Rotterdam VOC Series) — Set `26194`
A series of **portrait paintings** by **Pieter van der Werff** (1695–1722), depicting the directors (*bewindhebbers*) of the Rotterdam Chamber of the VOC. These were originally made for the *Nieuw Oost-Indisch Huis* (New East India House) at the Boompjes in Rotterdam. Examples include:

- `SK-A-4491` — Cornelis Matelieff the Younger

### 3. 🌏 **Gouverneurs-generaal serie** (Governors-General Series) — Set `26195` · **94 objects**
Paintings of **VOC governors-general** who presided from the Castle of Batavia (now Jakarta). The curatorial text explains these originally hung in the assembly hall of the castle—*"the centre of Dutch power in Asia."* Key portraits include:
- **Jan Pietersz Coen** (`SK-A-3758`, 1620–1675) — Whose description notes he *"exterminated the population of the Banda Islands to obtain the monopoly on nutmeg."*
- Governors-general from the 18th century, many painted anonymously in Asia itself.

### 4. 🦁 **Witte Leeuw** (White Lion) — Set `261115` · **1,185 objects**
One of the museum's largest sets, containing **Chinese kraakporselein (Kraak porcelain)** and other cargo recovered from the wreck of the VOC ship *Witte Leeuw*, which sank near **St. Helena before 1613**. The overwhelming volume of porcelain plates, bowls, and dishes testifies to the sheer scale of the China trade. These objects are also cross-listed in the **kraakporselein** set.

### 9. 🎨 **Key Individual Paintings** (from cross-collection searches, 553 VOC-related objects total)

Several paintings are central to the museum's maritime trade narrative and appear across multiple sets:

| Object | Title | Artist | Date | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------|------|-------------|
| **SK-A-4282** | *The Trading Post of the Dutch East India Company in Hooghly, Bengal* | Hendrik van Schuylenburgh | 1665 | Monumental painting (203 × 313 cm) showing the VOC factory on the Ganges, now displayed in the **"Netherlands Overseas" gallery**. The curatorial text explicitly notes Bengal was *"one of the places where the VOC bought the most people"* for slavery. **Top 1000**. |
| **SK-A-4062** | *Pieter Cnoll, Cornelia van Nijenrode, their Daughters and Two Enslaved Servants* | Jacob Coeman | 1665 | A family portrait painted in Batavia. The curatorial narrative highlights Surapati, one of the enslaved servants depicted, who later escaped slavery, fought against the VOC, and was proclaimed an **Indonesian national hero**. Part of **Against Opacity** and **Top 1000**. |
| **SK-A-4290** | *Apotheosis of the Dutch East India Company* | Nicolaas Verkolje | 1702–1746 | Allegory glorifying the Amsterdam Chamber of the VOC, based on a centenary medal. |

### Curatorial Themes and Critical Framing

The Rijksmuseum's approach is notably **multi-layered**. The sets don't just celebrate Dutch maritime achievement—they increasingly confront its darker legacies:

- The **Crown for the King of Ardra** is explicitly described as facilitating the slave trade.
- The **Hooghly painting** notes the VOC's involvement in human trafficking in Bengal.
- The **Cnoll family portrait** is part of the **"Against Opacity"** set, a curatorial initiative that surfaces hidden histories of slavery and colonialism.
- **Jan Pietersz Coen's** portrait labels him as having committed genocide in the Banda Islands.

In total, searching just for "VOC" yields **553 objects**, while "Dutch East India Company" in descriptions yields **84 more**. Combined with the curated sets above totaling well over **2,000 individual objects**, the Rijksmuseum holds one of the world's most comprehensive museum collections telling the story of Dutch maritime trade—from navigational instruments to porcelain cargo, from ship models to portraits of power, and increasingly, from the perspectives of those who were exploited by it.
