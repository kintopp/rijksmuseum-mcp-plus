## Japanese Prints at the Rijksmuseum: A Feasibility Assessment

### Collection Scale

The Rijksmuseum's Japanese holdings are substantial and well-organised:

| Measure | Count |
|---------|-------|
| **Japan collection (curated set 26134)** | **7,735 objects** |
| **Japanese textile stencils (curated set 26169)** | Dedicated sub-collection |
| **Japanese prints (description search)** | 134 (keyword-matched) |
| **Japan-related objects with images** | 1,510 (of 1,626 description matches = 92.9% digitised) |

### Curated Set Organisation

The Rijksmuseum maintains **two dedicated curated sets** for Japanese material:

1. **"Japan (collectie)"** (set 26134) — The main Japanese collection with 7,735 objects across all media: prints, paintings, ceramics, textiles, lacquerwork, metalwork, and more. This is a curatorially defined set, meaning every object has been explicitly classified as belonging to the Japanese collection by museum staff.

2. **"Japanse textielsjablonen"** (set 26169) — A specialised set of Japanese textile stencils (katagami), reflecting a specific collecting strength and perhaps a past exhibition or research project.

### What's in the Collection

A browse of the Japan set reveals considerable diversity:

**Types of material:**
- **Prints** (ukiyo-e and modern): including works by Takehisa Yumeji (1920s graphic design), as well as classical woodblock prints elsewhere in the collection
- **Hanging scrolls**: ink and pigment on silk paintings (e.g., Hashimoto Kansetsu's landscape, c. 1930)
- **Applied arts**: ceramics, lacquer, textiles
- **Documentary material**: sheet music covers, commercial prints, trade-related objects

**Temporal range:**
- The collection spans from pre-modern Japanese art through to 20th-century graphic design
- Recent acquisitions (object numbers like `RP-P-2022-107-*`) suggest active collecting continues

**Creators with authority links:**
- Artists like Hashimoto Kansetsu (1883-1945) and Takehisa Yumeji (1884-1934) have VIAF, ULAN, and Wikidata identifiers, enabling cross-referencing with international databases

### Strengths for a Research Project

1. **Scale**: 7,735 objects is a research collection, not a token representation. This is sufficient for quantitative analysis, thematic studies, and comparative projects.

2. **Digitisation**: The ~93% digitisation rate for Japan-related objects is exceptional. Most research can begin remotely, with on-site visits reserved for close examination.

3. **Curatorial organisation**: The dedicated curated set means the collection has been professionally defined — you are not relying on keyword searches to identify relevant objects.

4. **Cross-media breadth**: The collection includes prints alongside ceramics, textiles, and paintings, supporting interdisciplinary research on Japanese visual culture rather than medium-specific studies alone.

5. **Authority data**: Artist records linked to VIAF, ULAN, and Wikidata support integration with other museum databases and bibliographic resources.

### Limitations and Gaps

1. **Print specificity**: The 134 prints found via description search likely understates the true count. Many Japanese prints may not contain the word "Japan" in their description — they may simply be catalogued under the artist's name. The curated set (7,735) is the authoritative count for all Japanese objects, but it includes all media, not prints specifically.

2. **Classical ukiyo-e**: The browse sample surfaced mostly 20th-century material. The depth of the collection in classical ukiyo-e (Hokusai, Hiroshige, Utamaro, Sharaku) would need a targeted search by artist name to assess.

3. **Metadata language**: Object descriptions are predominantly in Dutch, with variable English coverage. Non-Dutch-speaking researchers will need either Dutch reading ability or reliance on the LLM's translation capabilities.

4. **Comparative context**: The Rijksmuseum's 7,735 Japanese objects should be contextualised against other major European collections of Japanese art (British Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, Musée Guimet). A grant application would benefit from positioning the Rijksmuseum's collection within this comparative landscape.

### Recommendation for Grant Applications

The Rijksmuseum's Japanese collection is **clearly sufficient** for a multi-year research project. Key points for a feasibility argument:

- **7,735 objects** in a curatorially defined collection
- **>90% digitised** with IIIF image access for remote study
- **Active collecting** (2022 acquisitions visible in the catalogue)
- **Two dedicated curated sets** indicating institutional investment in this area
- **Authority-linked artist data** supporting integration with international research infrastructure

The strongest grant applications would combine the Rijksmuseum's holdings with its institutional context: the museum's historical connection to Dutch-Japanese trade (VOC/Dejima), its recent investment in Asian art galleries, and its open data infrastructure that enables computational approaches to collection analysis.
