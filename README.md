# rijksmuseum-mcp+

An AI-powered interface to the [Rijksmuseum](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/) collection. Search artworks, explore their history, view high-resolution images, and access scholarly references — all through natural conversation.

Built on the Rijksmuseum's [Linked Open Data APIs](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/), the [Linked Art](https://linked.art/) and [Europeana Data Model](https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation) (EDM) standards, and the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP).

> This project was inspired by [@r-huijts/rijksmuseum-mcp](https://github.com/r-huijts/rijksmuseum-mcp), the original Rijksmuseum MCP server. That version used the museum's REST API which is no longer supported. This is a ground-up rewrite using the museum's newer Linked Open Data infrastructure and adds features like an interactive inline image viewer.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to try rijksmuseum-mcp+ is through the hosted version — no installation needed.

**Connect your MCP client to:**

## Searching the Collection

The `search_artwork` tool combines filters — creator, type, material, technique, date (with wildcards), description, depicted person (`aboutActor`), and image availability — that can be composed to answer questions no single filter handles alone.

### 1. Mapping an Artist's Output Across Media

**Research question:** What is the actual distribution of Rembrandt's works in the Rijksmuseum across painting, printmaking, and drawing — and how does this challenge popular perceptions of him as primarily a painter?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `search_artwork` with `creator: "Rembrandt"` and `compact: true` for a total count
- Repeat with `type: "painting"`, then `type: "print"`, then `type: "drawing"` to get counts per medium
- Follow up with `get_artwork_details` on selected works from each category

**Why it matters:** The Rijksmuseum holds ~30 Rembrandt paintings but over 1,000 prints and hundreds of drawings. Most students encounter Rembrandt through a handful of iconic canvases. Seeing the actual proportions reframes his practice as fundamentally graphic — a provocation for any survey course.

### 2. Tracing Artistic Networks Through Depicted Persons

**Research question:** How was Stadholder Frederik Hendrik portrayed across different media and by different artists? Can we reconstruct his visual propaganda programme from the collection?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `search_artwork` with `aboutActor: "Frederik Hendrik"` to find all depictions
- Filter by `type` to separate paintings, prints, medallions, and applied art
- Use `get_artwork_details` on results to identify artists, dates, and contexts
- `get_artist_timeline` on the key portraitists (e.g. Gerard van Honthorst) to see how court commissions fit within their broader careers

**Why it matters:** Court portraiture was a deliberate political instrument. Cross-referencing depicted person with medium and artist reveals whether the stadholder used different artists and formats for different audiences — painted portraits for diplomacy, prints for popular circulation, medals for military commemoration.

[**Sample output**](docs/02-frederik-hendrik-network-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 3. Material Culture Beyond the Canon

**Research question:** What is the scope of the Rijksmuseum's non-European holdings? How many Japanese prints, Indian textiles, Indonesian objects, and Chinese ceramics are in the collection?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `search_artwork` with `compact: true` and targeted material/technique/type filters: `material: "porcelain"`, `technique: "woodcut"`, `type: "textile"`
- Cross-reference with `description` searches for geographic terms
- Use `imageAvailable: true` to assess digitisation coverage

**Why it matters:** The Rijksmuseum positions itself as a museum of Dutch art *and* history, which includes centuries of global trade. Researchers planning comparative or postcolonial projects need to know what's actually there — and what's been digitised — before committing to an archival visit.

[**Sample output**](docs/03-non-european-holdings-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 4. Technique-Based Discovery

**Research question:** Who were the leading practitioners of mezzotint in the Dutch Republic, and how does the Rijksmuseum's holdings reflect the medium's rise and decline?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `search_artwork` with `technique: "mezzotint"` and `compact: true` for a total count
- Add `creationDate: "167*"`, `"168*"`, `"169*"`, `"170*"` to track the technique's trajectory decade by decade
- Use `get_artwork_details` to identify the printmakers and their connections

**Why it matters:** Mezzotint was a technically demanding medium with a specific historical arc — invented c. 1642, flourishing in the late 17th century, declining in the 18th. The collection search lets you empirically map that arc rather than relying on secondary accounts, and discover lesser-known practitioners alongside the familiar names.

[**Sample output**](docs/04-mezzotint-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 5. Date-Range Exploration for Period Studies

**Research question:** What did the Rijksmuseum's holdings look like for the crisis decade of the 1670s — the *Rampjaar* and its aftermath? Is there a measurable drop in artistic production?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `search_artwork` with `creationDate: "166*"` vs `"167*"` vs `"168*"` and `compact: true` to compare counts
- Filter by `type: "painting"` to isolate the medium most sensitive to patronage disruption
- Examine specific years: `creationDate: "1672"`, `"1673"` for the Rampjaar itself

**Why it matters:** The French invasion of 1672 devastated the Dutch economy and disrupted patronage networks. Art historians debate the severity and duration of the impact. Collection-level counting across date ranges gives a quantitative baseline that complements archival evidence about individual workshops.

## Artwork Details and Metadata

`get_artwork_details` returns up to 24 metadata categories per artwork — far more than a typical museum search interface exposes. This depth enables object-level research that would otherwise require on-site catalogue consultation.

### 6. Provenance as Historical Evidence

**Research question:** What can the ownership history of Vermeer's *The Milkmaid* tell us about the painting's changing reputation from the 17th century to the present?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `get_artwork_details` with `objectNumber: "SK-A-2344"` returns the full provenance chain
- Cross-reference owners and sale dates with the bibliography via `get_artwork_bibliography`
- Use `get_artwork_image` to examine the painting alongside the provenance narrative

**Why it matters:** When a work changes hands at auction, is gifted to a museum, or passes through a dealer's inventory, each transaction reflects contemporary taste and valuation. The structured provenance data makes this traceable without requesting a physical dossier from the museum.

[**Sample output**](docs/06-milkmaid-provenance-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 7. Reading Inscriptions as Primary Sources

**Research question:** What textual information did Pieter Saenredam embed in his church interior paintings, and do the inscriptions serve documentary, devotional, or artistic purposes?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `search_artwork` with `creator: "Pieter Saenredam"` and `type: "painting"`
- `get_artwork_details` on each result — the inscriptions category captures text transcribed from the painting surface
- Compare inscription content across works: dates, church names, biblical texts, artist signatures

**Why it matters:** Saenredam's inscriptions are unusually rich — they often include the exact date he made the preliminary drawing and the date he completed the painting, sometimes years apart. These inscriptions are primary evidence for his working method and his understanding of architectural accuracy as a form of historical record-keeping. The metadata category makes them searchable without needing to zoom into every painting.

[**Sample output**](docs/07-saenredam-inscriptions-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 8. Dimensions as Evidence for Workshop Practice

**Research question:** Were there standard panel sizes used in 17th-century Dutch workshops? Can we identify clusters of dimensions that suggest pre-prepared supports from panel makers?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `search_artwork` with `type: "painting"`, `material: "panel"`, `creationDate: "16*"`
- `get_artwork_details` on a sample — structured dimensions give height and width in centimetres
- Tabulate dimensions across dozens of works to look for recurring sizes

**Why it matters:** Art historians know that panel makers supplied standardised supports, but the exact sizes varied by city and period. The Rijksmuseum's structured dimension data — as opposed to free-text descriptions — enables computational analysis across the collection. Clusters in the data would corroborate (or challenge) what we know from guild records.

[**Sample output**](docs/08-panel-sizes-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 9. Vocabulary Terms and External Authority Links

**Research question:** How does the Rijksmuseum classify its Indonesian textile collection, and how do those classifications map to the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `search_artwork` with `material: "batik"` or `type: "textile"` + `description: "Indonesia"`
- `get_artwork_details` on results — vocabulary terms are resolved to English labels with links to Getty AAT and Wikidata
- Compare the Rijksmuseum's taxonomy with AAT hierarchies to identify where local classifications diverge from international standards

**Why it matters:** Controlled vocabularies shape how collections are discovered and interpreted. When a museum uses its own vocabulary terms rather than (or in addition to) international standards, the mapping between them reveals assumptions about categorisation. This is especially significant for non-Western material culture, where Western taxonomies may be inadequate.

[**Sample output**](docs/09-indonesian-textiles-aat-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 10. Credit Lines and Acquisition Context

**Research question:** How did the Rijksmuseum acquire its core Rembrandt collection? What proportion came through purchase, bequest, or state allocation, and when?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `search_artwork` with `creator: "Rembrandt"` and `type: "painting"`
- `get_artwork_details` on each — the credit line records the acquisition mode and often the year
- Cross-reference with provenance for the full chain

**Why it matters:** A museum's acquisition history is itself a subject of art historical study. The pattern of Rembrandt acquisitions — especially in the 19th-century period of national canon-building — reveals institutional priorities and art market dynamics. The credit line field makes this systematically researchable.

[**Sample output**](docs/10-rembrandt-acquisitions-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

---

## Bibliographic References

`get_artwork_bibliography` exposes the museum's scholarship tracking — from five references for minor works to over a hundred for masterpieces. This is a ready-made literature review.

### 11. Measuring Scholarly Attention

**Research question:** Which artworks in the Rijksmuseum have received disproportionate scholarly attention, and which major works remain understudied?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `get_artwork_bibliography` with `full: false` (summary mode) on a set of canonical works — returns total citation counts
- Compare counts: *The Night Watch* (100+) vs lesser-known works by the same artist
- Identify works with unexpectedly low counts for their significance

**Why it matters:** A researcher looking for a dissertation topic benefits from knowing where the gaps are — a major painting with only a handful of references represents an opportunity, while one with 150 entries signals an already-crowded field.

[**Sample output**](docs/11-scholarly-attention-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 12. Building a Literature Review

**Research question:** What is the complete published scholarship on Jan Asselijn's *The Threatened Swan*, and how has its interpretation changed over time?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `get_artwork_bibliography` with `objectNumber: "SK-A-4"` and `full: true`
- Review the chronological sequence of publications — early catalogue entries, monograph treatments, interpretive essays
- Use ISBNs and WorldCat links to locate sources in university libraries

**Why it matters:** The bibliography tool provides a structured starting point with publication metadata (authors, titles, years, ISBNs) that would otherwise require consulting the museum's paper files or visiting the Rijksprentenkabinet library.

[**Sample output**](docs/12-threatened-swan-scholarship-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 13. Tracking Exhibition History Through Catalogues

**Research question:** How often has Vermeer's *The Little Street* been lent to exhibitions outside the Rijksmuseum, and which exhibitions chose to feature it?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `get_artwork_bibliography` with `full: true` on the relevant object number
- Filter results for exhibition catalogue entries (typically identifiable by their format: exhibition venue + date + catalogue number)
- Map the exhibition loans geographically and chronologically

**Why it matters:** Exhibition history reveals how a work's canonical status is constructed. A Vermeer that travels frequently plays a different role in art historical discourse than one that stays in Amsterdam. The bibliography data captures this exhibition history as a by-product of its cataloguing.

[**Sample output**](docs/13-little-street-exhibitions-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

## High-Resolution Images

`get_artwork_image` provides IIIF deep-zoom access — resolution sufficient to examine individual brushstrokes, craquelure patterns, and inscriptions that are invisible in standard reproductions.

### 14. Technical Art History at the Brushstroke Level

**Research question:** Can we distinguish between Rembrandt's direct brushwork and studio assistant contributions in *The Night Watch* by examining paint application at high magnification?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `get_artwork_image` with `objectNumber: "SK-C-5"` opens the interactive deep-zoom viewer
- Zoom to maximum resolution on areas of known debate (e.g. the background figures vs the central group)
- Compare paint handling: impasto density, brush direction, layering technique

**Why it matters:** Connoisseurship — attributing hands within a workshop — traditionally requires direct access to an artwork. The IIIF deep-zoom viewer doesn't replace in-person examination, but it enables preliminary analysis and is of great value for teaching.

### 15. Reading Illegible Inscriptions

**Research question:** What text appears on the cartouche in the background of a 17th-century group portrait, and does it identify the sitters or the occasion?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `search_artwork` to find the relevant group portrait
- `get_artwork_image` to access the deep-zoom viewer
- Zoom and rotate to read text that is invisible or illegible in catalogue reproductions
- Cross-reference with the inscriptions field from `get_artwork_details`

**Why it matters:** Inscriptions in paintings can contain documentary information — dates, names, Latin mottos, biblical references — that is simply too small to read in printed reproductions or web thumbnails. Deep-zoom access makes this text legible outside the gallery.

### 16. Comparative Detail Analysis Across Works

**Research question:** How does Rachel Ruysch's rendering of insects evolve across her career — do the entomological details become more or less precise over time?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `get_artist_timeline` for Rachel Ruysch to get her works in chronological order
- `get_artwork_image` on early, mid-career, and late works
- Zoom to the insect details in each and compare rendering technique, anatomical accuracy, and compositional placement

**Why it matters:** Ruysch is known for the scientific precision of her natural history details — her father was a renowned anatomist. Tracking the fidelity of her entomological rendering across a 60-year career (she painted into her 80s) addresses questions about ageing, changing standards of naturalism, and the relationship between art and science in the Dutch Republic.

---

## Artist Timelines

`get_artist_timeline` arranges an artist's works chronologically, revealing career patterns invisible when browsing search results.

### 17. Identifying Gaps and Productive Periods

**Research question:** Are there unexplained gaps in Hendrick Goltzius's output at the Rijksmuseum, and do they correspond to known biographical events — his Italian journey, health problems, or the shift from engraving to painting?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `get_artist_timeline` with `artist: "Hendrick Goltzius"` and `maxWorks: 25`
- Map the chronological distribution: clusters, gaps, isolated works
- Cross-reference gap years with the biography from `get_artwork_details`

**Why it matters:** An artist's timeline is a narrative. A gap in the 1590s might mean the museum simply doesn't hold works from that period, or it might reflect a real disruption in practice. The timeline tool makes these patterns visible, prompting the researcher to investigate further.

[**Sample output**](docs/17-goltzius-gaps-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 18. Medium Shifts Within a Career

**Research question:** When did Goltzius transition from engraving to painting, and does the collection evidence support the traditional art historical narrative of a sudden conversion?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `get_artist_timeline` for Goltzius to see the full sequence
- `get_artwork_details` on each work to get medium and technique
- Show the medium of each work chronologically to see if the shift is abrupt or gradual

**Why it matters:** The standard account says Goltzius abandoned engraving for painting around 1600 due to arthritis in his right hand. But "abandoned" implies a clean break. If the timeline shows overlapping media — engravings continuing alongside paintings — the biographical narrative needs revision.

[**Sample output**](docs/18-goltzius-transition-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 19. Comparing Parallel Careers

**Research question:** How do the career trajectories of Jan Steen and Gabriël Metsu compare — two genre painters active in the same cities at the same time?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `get_artist_timeline` for both artists
- Compare: date ranges, number of works per decade, medium distribution
- Use `get_artwork_details` on representative works from each to compare subject matter and scale

**Why it matters:** Parallel career comparison is a standard art historical method for understanding market positioning, artistic rivalry, and influence. The timeline tool generates the raw data for this comparison in seconds rather than hours of catalogue consultation.

[**Sample output**](docs/19-steen-vs-metsu-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

---

## Curated Sets

`list_curated_sets` and `browse_set` expose the museum's 192 curatorial groupings — thematic, scholarly, and exhibition-based. These sets encode expert knowledge about how objects relate to each other.

### 20. Reconstructing Past Exhibitions

**Research question:** What was included in a specific Rijksmuseum exhibition, and how did the curatorial selection construct a narrative about the topic?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `list_curated_sets` with a keyword filter to find the relevant set
- `browse_set` with the set identifier to retrieve all included objects
- `get_artwork_details` on key objects to understand what they contribute to the exhibition thesis

**Why it matters:** Exhibitions are arguments made with objects — the selection, sequencing, and juxtaposition of works constitutes an interpretation. Being able to retrieve the object list for a past exhibition enables historiographic analysis of curatorial practice.

[**Sample output**](docs/20-rembrandt-exhibitions-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 21. Finding Thematic Connections Curators Have Already Made

**Research question:** Has the Rijksmuseum curated any groupings related to Dutch maritime trade, and what objects did they consider central to that story?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `list_curated_sets` with `query: "maritime"` or `query: "trade"` or `query: "VOC"`
- `browse_set` to see the contents — paintings, maps, ship models, porcelain, documents
- Use the cross-media nature of curated sets to discover objects outside your disciplinary comfort zone

**Why it matters:** Researchers tend to search within their medium speciality. Curated sets cross media boundaries, placing a Delftware plate next to a ship portrait next to a navigation chart. This cross-media juxtaposition can reveal connections that medium-specific searches miss.

[**Sample output**](docs/21-maritime-trade-sets-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 22. Assessing Collection Depth for Grant Applications

**Research question:** Does the Rijksmuseum have sufficient holdings in Japanese prints to support a multi-year research project, and how are they organised?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `list_curated_sets` filtered for Japanese-related sets
- `browse_set` on relevant sets to assess quantity, quality, and variety
- `search_artwork` with targeted filters to check for holdings outside the curated sets

**Why it matters:** Grant applications require demonstrating that the proposed research site has adequate resources. Being able to programmatically assess collection depth — and cite specific set identifiers and object counts — strengthens the feasibility argument.

[**Sample output**](docs/22-japanese-prints-grant-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

## Collection Changes

`get_recent_changes` tracks what the museum adds and updates, providing a live feed of cataloguing activity.

### 23. Monitoring New Acquisitions in a Research Area

**Research question:** Has the Rijksmuseum recently acquired any 18th-century decorative arts that would be relevant to my dissertation on Enlightenment material culture?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `get_recent_changes` with a date range covering the last quarter or year
- Use `identifiersOnly: true` for a fast scan, then `get_artwork_details` on promising object numbers
- Set up a periodic check (monthly) to stay current

**Why it matters:** New acquisitions can reshape a research project — a recently acquired object might fill a gap in the evidence, or a newly digitised work might provide a crucial comparison. The change-tracking feed ensures researchers can immediately discover relevant new acquisitions.

[**Sample output**](docs/23-new-acquisitions-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 24. Tracking Metadata Enrichment

**Research question:** Has the Rijksmuseum recently updated its catalogue entries for its Asian art holdings — perhaps adding new provenance information or revised attributions?

**How the tools enable it:**
- `get_recent_changes` filtered to a curated set (if one exists for Asian art)
- Compare current `get_artwork_details` with earlier records to identify what changed
- Focus on fields like provenance, attribution, and date that affect research conclusions

**Why it matters:** Museum catalogues are living documents. Attributions change, provenance is discovered, dates are revised. Researchers who rely on catalogue data need to know when it changes, especially for fields like provenance where new information can alter the interpretive framework.

## The LLM fills in the gaps

Because the MCP tools are used through a large language model, the LLM's own knowledge can act as a bridge between the researcher's question and the API's formal parameters.

### 25. Multilingual Access to a Dutch Collection

**Research question:** A Japanese scholar studying *Rangaku* (Dutch learning in Edo-period Japan) wants to find VOC-related objects but searches in Japanese and English, not Dutch.

**How the LLM enables it:**
- The researcher asks in English: "Find objects related to the Dutch trading post at Dejima"
- The LLM knows that Dejima is romanised from 出島, that the Dutch called it "Deshima," and that the Rijksmuseum catalogues it under various Dutch spellings
- It searches with the appropriate terms and explains the results in the researcher's language

**Why it matters:** The Rijksmuseum's metadata is partially in Dutch, with varying degrees of English translation. Non-Dutch-speaking researchers face a real language barrier. The LLM doesn't just translate — it can often handle variant spellings, historical place names, and terminological differences between languages.

[**Sample output**](docs/25-rangaku-dejima-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 26. Cross-Referencing Art Historical Knowledge

**Research question:** A student in a survey course wants to find works by artists associated with the Utrecht Caravaggisti — but doesn't know which specific artists that includes.

**How the LLM enables it:**
- The student asks: "Show me works by the Utrecht Caravaggisti"
- The LLM identifies the relevant artists (Honthorst, Baburen, Ter Brugghen, van Bijlert) from its training knowledge
- It runs multiple `search_artwork` queries and synthesises the results

**Why it matters:** Art historical categories like "Utrecht Caravaggisti" are not search terms in the museum's metadata — they are scholarly constructs that group artists by style, period, and geography. The LLM can bridge from the category to the individual names, enabling conceptual searches that no fielded search interface supports.

[**Sample output**](docs/26-utrecht-caravaggisti-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 27. Disambiguation and Collection Awareness

**Research question:** A student wants to compare Vermeer's *Girl with a Pearl Earring* with his *The Milkmaid*. Are both in the Rijksmuseum?

**How the LLM enables it:**
- The LLM knows that *Girl with a Pearl Earring* is at the Mauritshuis in The Hague, not the Rijksmuseum
- It explains the distinction, retrieves *The Milkmaid* from the Rijksmuseum, and suggests the Mauritshuis as a second source
- It can also suggest Vermeer works that *are* in the Rijksmuseum for comparison

**Why it matters:** Students frequently misattribute works to institutions. Rather than returning a confusing 'no results', the LLM can correct the error, explain it, and redirect productively.

[**Sample output**](docs/27-vermeer-disambiguation-opus.md) Generated by Claude Opus 4.6

### 28. Navigating Variant Names and Historical Spelling

**Research question:** A student searches for "Hercules Seghers" — but the Rijksmuseum catalogues him as "Segers."

**How the LLM enables it:**
- The LLM recognises the spelling variant and searches under the museum's canonical form
- It explains the discrepancy so the student understands why a direct search would have failed
- It surfaces all 77 works without the student needing to guess the correct spelling

**Why it matters:** Historical names are notoriously unstable — Rembrandt van Rijn / Ryn, Albrecht Dürer / Durer / Duerer, Pieter Brueghel / Bruegel / Breughel. Every variant that differs from the museum's canonical form is a failed search. For well-known artists, an LLM can usually handle this seamlessly, drawing on its knowledge of naming conventions across art historical traditions.

### Data Sources

The server uses the Rijksmuseum's open APIs with no authentication required:

| API | URL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Search API | `https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/search/collection` | Field-based search (title, creator, depicted person, type, material, technique, date, description, image availability), returns Linked Art URIs |
| Linked Art resolver | `https://id.rijksmuseum.nl/{id}` | Object metadata, vocabulary terms, and bibliography as JSON-LD |
| IIIF Image API | `https://iiif.micr.io/{id}/info.json` | High-resolution image tiles |
| OAI-PMH | `https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/oai` | Curated sets, EDM metadata records, date-based change tracking. 192 sets, 836K+ records. |

**Image discovery chain (4 HTTP hops):** Object `.shows` > VisualItem `.digitally_shown_by` > DigitalObject `.access_point` > IIIF info.json

**Vocabulary resolution:** Material, object type, technique, place, collection, and subject terms are Rijksmuseum vocabulary URIs. These are resolved in parallel to obtain English labels and links to external authorities (Getty AAT, Wikidata, Iconclass).

**Subject discovery chain:** Object `.shows` > VisualItem `.represents_instance_of_type` (Iconclass concepts) + `.represents` (depicted persons and places). Subject URIs are batched with the existing vocabulary resolution pass.

**Bibliography resolution:** Publication references resolve to Schema.org Book records (a different JSON-LD context from the Linked Art artwork data) with author, title, ISBN, and WorldCat links.

### Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | HTTP server port (presence triggers HTTP mode) | `3000` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | CORS origins (comma-separated) | `*` |
